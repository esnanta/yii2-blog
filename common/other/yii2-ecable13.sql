(2,23,1,'Indonesia Sebagai Anggota Tidak Tetap Dewan Keamanan PBB di Mata Akademisi','',NULL,'<p>Indonesia baru saja ditetapkan sebagai salah satu anggota tidak tetap Dewan Keamanan melalui sidang yang diadakan pada Juni 2018 di New York. Hal ini tentunya menjadi hal yang membanggakan mengingat tidak semua Negara di dunia bisa mendapatkan kepercayaan untuk menjadi anggota tidak tetap Dewan Keamanan PBB. Indonesia dengan statusnya saat ini tentu memiliki beberapa hak dan tanggung jawab yang harus diemban. Hal ini secara tidak langsung memberikan tantangan sekaligus keuntungan politik bagi Indonesia di level internasional. Lalu bagaimana sebaiknya Indonesia memanfaatkan posisi ini? Apa strategi yang harus dipersiapkan oleh pemerintah Indonesia untuk memanfaatkan dan memaksimalkan momen ini agar dapat meraih kepentingan nasional Indonesia yang lebih besar lagi? Untuk itu hubunganinternasional.id meminta tanggapan dari salah satu akademisi Hubungan Internasional yang bernama Septyanto Galan Prakoso (SGP) yang sekaligus sebagai salah satu dosen pengampu mata kuliah Politik Luar Negeri Indonesia di Universitas Sebelas Maret Surakarta untuk memberikan tanggapannya mengenai hal ini</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>hubunganinternasional.id (hi.id) :</strong> <strong>Bagaimana pendapat anda tentang terpilihnya indonesia sebagai salah satu anggota tidak tetap Dewan Keamanan PBB?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSeptyanto Galan Prakoso (SGP) : <em>Tentu senang dan bangga. Kita patut mengapresiasi kinerja para diplomat Indonesia di Kementerian Luar Negeri yang telah memperjuangkan hal ini.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>(hi.id) : Bagaimana seharusnya indonesia memanfaatkan kondisi ini khususnya untuk kepentingan bangsa indonesia sendiri dan masyarakt internasional pada umumnya?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSGP: <em>Saya kira dengan capaian ini, Indonesia akan memiliki posisi tawar serta citra yang lebih kuat dalam rentang waktu 2019-2020, di kancah politik internasional. Secara spesifik, saya cenderung lebih &ldquo;nyaman&rdquo; jika Indonesia dapat memaksimalkan posisi ini dalam memperjuangkan isu-isu kemanusiaan dan sosial internasional.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>(hi.id) :</strong> <strong>Tantangan yang dihadapi indonesia sebagai anggota tidak tetap Dewan Keamanan PBB seperti apa?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSGP : <em>Tentu saja tekanan dari berbagai pihak; dari negara-negara kuat yang memiliki kepentingan dalam pergulatan politik internasional, aktor-aktor internasional yang juga membawa objektif masing-masing, hingga anggota Dewan Keamanan yang lain (tetap maupun tidak tetap). Dan jangan lupakan juga tekanan dari dalam negeri. Banyak masyarakat Indonesia yang masih belum melek hubungan internasional. Ketika kita mendapatkan pencapaian, terpilih sebagai anggota Dewan Keamanan tidak tetap, masih banyak kelompok masyarakat yang tetap apatis bahkan bereaksi negatif terhadap hal tersebut dengan membandingkannya dengan kondisi kesejahteraan dalam negeri; yang notabene jelas tidak ada sangkut pautnya secara langsung.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>(hi.id) : Status indonesia sebagai anggota tidak tetap Dewan Keaman PBB sedikit banyaknya membawa angin segar bagi masyarakat Indonesia khususnya dalam hal menjembatani proses penyelesaian konflik Israel-Palestina. Bagaimana anda melihat hal ini?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSGP : <em>Saya masih skeptis. Seperti yang sempat disinggung diatas, kurangnya informasi akan posisi dan manfaat terpilihnya Indonesia sebagai anggota Dewan Keamanan tidak tetap PBB kepada rakyat Indonesia sendiri justru dapat menimbulkan tekanan-tekanan yang tidak perlu terhadap pemerintah dari kelompok-kelompok tertentu. Padahal penyelesaian konflik Israel-Palestina jelas tidak mudah, dan tidak mungkin selesai dalam waktu 2 tahun, kan? Hal yang paling baik yang bias dilakukan Indonesia dalam jangka waktu 2 tahun kedepan terkait konflik tersebut adalah ikut berpartisipasi membangun ground framework bagi proses resolusi konlflik Israel-Palestina itu sendiri. Selama masih ada pihak yang masih menolak untuk duduk di satu meja, konflik tidak akan pernah selesai.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>(hi.id) : Bagaimana sebaiknya arah politik luar negeri Indonesia dengan status Indonesia sebagai anggota tidak tetap Dewan Keamanan PBB yang akan berlangsung hingga 2020?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSGP : <em>Meskipun terkesan tidak tegas, Indonesia dapat mengambil contoh dari politik luar negeri Thailand selama ini, yakni Bend Like Bamboo with the Wind; dalam hal ini, meskipun terkesan dapat terombang ambing oleh angin kesana kemari, bamboo itu sendiri tidak patah dan tetap kokoh. Artinya, meskipun situasi politik internasional menimbulkan sway yang luar biasa terhadap arah politik luar negeri, Indonesia berhak menyikapi secara terbuka dan moderat, akan tetapi tetap berpegang teguh kepada prinsip-prinsip politik luar negeri yang telah dilaksanakan sekian lama.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/zHBS_40huaLrF2X9.jpeg\" style=\"height:280px; width:280px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>image</em>: https://www.quora.com/Who-created-the-United-Nations-logo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebagaimana yang telah kita ketahui bersama Indonesia kembali mendapatkan kepercayaan dari dunia Internasional untuk menjadi anggota tidak tetap Dewan Keamanan PBB untuk yang ketiga kalinya yaitu untuk masa jabatan 2019-2020.

Puncak dari perjuangan tersebut pun bertepatan pada tanggal 17 Agustus 1945 dengan dibacanya Proklamasi Kemerdekaan Negara Republik Indonesia oleh Presiden Soekarno. Proklamasi tersebut sekaligus menandakan berdirinya Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia sebagai salah satu Negara berdaulat seperti Negara-negara lainnya yang ada di dunia.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/Db7TMTvAXbkAk3cq.jpg\" style=\"height:336px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image <a href=\"http://bahaiteachings.org/ending-era-unfettered-national-sovereignty\">http://bahaiteachings.org/ending-era-unfettered-national-sovereignty</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Akan tetapi tahukah anda bahwa berdirinya sebuah Negara memiliki syarat-syarat tertentu?

Akan tetapi syarat pada poin 4 mungkin akan membuat beberapa orang bertanya. Kita sebagai putra-putri Bangsa Indonesia boleh saja mengaku bahwa kita merdeka pada 17 Agustus 1945. Akan tetapi bagi di mata Belanda, Indonesia diakui sebagai Negara berdaulat melalui pemberian kemerdekaan oleh Belanda pada 27 Desember 1949. Lalu, mengapa pengakuan dari Negara lain menjadi hal yang penting bagi kemerdekaan sebuah bangsa?</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Makna Pengakuan Sebagai Negara Berdaulat</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Pengakuan kedaulatan kepada suatu Negara oleh Negara lain menjadi salah satu syarat berdirinya sebuah Negara. Hal ini masih erat kaitannya dengan tiga poin sebelumnya yaitu kepemilikan terhadap wilayah, memiliki rakyat dan tentunya pemerintahan. Adanya pengakuan dari Negara lain berarti tiga komponen di atas sudah diakui eksistensinya. Secara sederhana dijelaskan sebagai berikut ini: </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">A.

Hal ini berarti Indonesia diakui sebagai salah satu dari Negara berdaulat di dunia yang mengikuti system tatanan dunia internasional ketika saat itu. Sama halnya dengan Negara-negara dunia maju ketika itu yang harus dihormati wilayah kedaulatannya (seperti tidak boleh dicaplok, diserang, dilanggar batas wilayahnya). Untuk itu Indonesia layak diperlakukan sebagaimana Negara berdaulat lain yang harus dihormati eksistensinya. Indonesia memiliki batas wilayah yang harus dihormati, oleh karena itu segala bentuk pelanggaran batas wilayah kedaulatan, maka Indonesia berhak membela diri dengan memberikan perlawanan.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/RT-UnPGDznwSgR6P.jpg\" style=\"height:117px; width:142px\" /></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em> <a href=\"http://www.unlhumanrights.org/01/0103/0103_06.htm\">http://www.unlhumanrights.org/01/0103/0103_06.htm</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Pasca Proklamasi Kemerdekaan oleh Presiden Soekarno perlu diingat bahwasanya penjajah tidak diam begitu saja dan mencoba mengambil alih beberapa wilayah Indonesia. Belanda sebagai penjajah Indonesia tidak mau mengakui kemerdekaan Indonesia pada tahun 1945 dan memutuskan untuk melakukan agresi ke wilayah kedaulatan Indonesia. Kenyataan ini mengharuskan Indonesia mempertahankan kedaulatannya melalui perang. Salah satu Perang pasca kemerdekaan yang sangat dikenang tentunya perang untuk membebaskan Irian Barat. Perlawanan Indonesia ketika itu adalah bentuk mempertahankan wilayah kedaulatan dan eksistensinya sebagai Negara berdaulat.

Hal ini membebaskan Negara-negara penjajah untuk mengambil rakyat dari Negara tersebut untuk kemudian digunakan sesuai dengan kepentingannya seperti budak dan tentara. Dalam prakteknya banyak Negara-negara penjajah ketika itu menggunakan metode ini untuk meraih keuntungan seperti mengambil masyarakat local untuk dijadikan budak yang dipekerjakan paksa. Atau dengan menjadikan beberapa dari mereka tentara untuk membantu ekspansi Negara penjajah dan tentunya ditempatkan di barisan paling depan agar mati duluan. Kondisi-kondisi terserbut adalah hal yang umum terjadi ketika jaman penjajahan. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Pengakuan Indonesia sebagai Negara berdaulat secara tidak langsung mengakui eksistensi Warga Negara Indonesia yang terikat pada Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia (meskipun pada saat itu belum ada <em>e</em>-KTP). Segala tindakan yang mengancam eksistensi Warga Negara di suatu wilayah tentunya sudah tidak dapat dibenarkan lagi. Kondisi ini tentunya mengganggu serta merugikan Negara penjajah karena tidak bisa mengambil keuntungan lebih. Kesadaran rakyat Indonesia saat itu menjadi penting karena menjadi salah satu modal awal untuk melawan segala bentuk penjajahan. Hal seperti ini juga berlaku di Negara lain dan menjadi alasan munculnya gerakan-gerakan Nasionalis. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">C.

Terlepas dari system apa yang digunakan dalam pemerintahannya, Negara tetap membutuhkan sekelompok orang yang tergabung dalam sebuah lembaga untuk kemudian mengatur dan menjalankan tugas serta fungsi Negara. Mulai dari kepala pemerintahan, militer, ekonomi, pemerintahan daerah dan sebagainya. Pemerintahan di Negara yang baru berdiri inilah kemudian yang berhak memutuskan arah tujuan dari bangsa ini ke depannya. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Adanya pemerintahan di dalam suatu Negara juga berguna untuk menghalangi Negara dari upaya penjajah dalam mendirikan &ldquo;pemerintahan boneka&rdquo; yang akan digunakan untuk kepentingan-kepentingan dari Negara penjajah. Karena sejatinya pemerintahan di suatu Negara dibentuk untuk tujuan kemakmuran Negara itu sendiri bukan Negara lain apalagi penjajah.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Kesimpulan</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Meskipun Indonesia mengklaim kemerdekaan pada 17 Agustus 1945 tetapi pengakuan dari Belanda sebagai Negara penjajah baru datang pada 27 Desember 1949. Kemerdekaan suatu Negara tidak cukup hanya melalui perjuangan di level domestic saja, tetapi juga membutuhkan perjuangan di level internasional. Mendapatkan pengakuan dari Negara lain adalah salah satu perjuangan Indonesia di level Internasional untuk memulai eksistensinya. Untuk itu mari kita menghargai kemerdekaan yang telah diraih dengan susah payah ini.

Seperti halnya Indonesia, Belanda juga merupakan sebuah negara yang mendapatkan banyak keuntungan dari sektor pariwisatanya. Sesuai dengan data yang dikeluarkan oleh World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (2018), sektor pariwisata Belanda telah menyumbang sebanyak US$ 43.1 milyar atau 5.2% dari total GDP negara tersebut pada tahun 2017. Lebih lanjut, data yang diperoleh oleh WTTC menunjukkan bahwa angka wisatawan asing yang mengunjungi Belanda mencapai 16.3 juta jiwa pada tahun yang sama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/mjtodBtH81E-nBb1.jpg\" style=\"height:534px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: Dokumentasi Pribadi</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBelanda adalah negara tujuan pariwisata yang terkenal dalam bidang sejarah serta seninya. Di Kota Amsterdam, kita dapat menemukan sebuah distrik bernama Museumkwartier. Distrik tersebut dikhususkan sebagai wilayah utama tempat museum dan galeri seni berdiri. Beberapa tempat terkenal yang berdiri di distrik tersebut Rijksmuseum dan Vincent van Gogh Museum yang menampilkan seni-seni dari abad pertengahan, serta Banksy Museum yang menampilkan seni-seni modern beraliran street art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSelain terkenal akan wisata sejarah dan seninya, Belanda juga dikenal sebagai sebuah negara yang menawarkan tujuan wisata yang tidak lazim. Industri seks adalah sebuah sektor pariwisata lain yang ditawarkan oleh Belanda. Industri seks dan prostitusi merupakan kegiatan yang dianggap illegal di banyak negara di dunia. Lain halnya di Belanda. industri seks telah dilegalisasi oleh pemerintah sejak tahun 2000. Hotspot dan ikon wisata seks Belanda dapat dijumpai di Red Light District yang terletak di De Wallen, Amsterdam. Wilayah tersebut adalah pusat utama dari industri seks Belanda yang berkembang melalui keberadaan rumah bordil, sex club, dan cabaret show. Saat saya mengunjungi Kota Amsterdam, saya berkesempatan untuk mengikuti walking tour yang banyak membahas mengenai sejarah wilayah Red Light dan industri seks Belanda, khususnya di Kota Amsterdam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nKegiatan prostitusi dan industri seks bukan merupakan hal yang baru di Belanda. Kota-kota pelabuhan di Belanda seperti Amsterdam dan Rotterdam adalah wilayah yang terkenal akan industri seksnya sejak abad ke-17. Pemerintah pada masa tersebut menetapkan kegiatan prostitusi dan industri seks sebagai kegiatan illegal. Walau demikian, praktik tersebut masih banyak terjadi secara luas dan sembunyi-sembunyi. Sebelum adanya legalisasi, aktivitas prostitusi dan industri seks di Belanda banyak menuai protes dari masyarakat karena tingginya angka penyakit menular seksual dan kekerasan seksual. Hingga tahun 1990-an, Pemerintah Kota Amsterdam tidak terlalu memperhatikan adanya pelanggaran hukum dalam kegiatan prostitusi di wilayah mereka (Spapens &amp; Rijken, 2014). Perubahan pun akhirnya terjadi pada tahun 2000, dimana Pemerintah Belanda memutuskan untuk menghapuskan Dutch Criminal Code artikel ke 250 dan 432 yang mengakibatkan berubahnya status industri seks dan aktivitas prostitusi menjadi legal. Dengan adanya legalisasi tersebut, pekerja seks adalah salah satu profesi yang terdaftar dalam Undang-Undang, sehingga para pekerja seks pun mempunyai hak dan kewajiban yang sama seperti halnya pekerja di Belanda. Para pekerja seks diwajibkan untuk membayar pajak penghasilan dan berhak mendapatkan asuransi kesehatan serta check-up kesehatan secara rutin dari pemerintah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nKarena adanya legalisasi industri seks dan aktivitas prostitusi oleh Pemerintah Belanda tersebut, negara memperoleh lebih banyak keuntungan. Seperti yang telah disebutkan di atas, total jumlah wisatawan asing yang mengunjungi Belanda adalah sebanyak 16.3 jiwa dan sektor pariwisata menyumbang sebanyak 5.2% dari total GDP Belanda. Menurut data yang diperoleh saat saya mengikuti Red Light District Tour (2018), industri seks Belanda telah menarik 60% dari total wisatawan asing yang berkunjung ke negara tersebut. Legalisasi industri seks dan kegiatan prostitusi di Belanda mengakibatkan naiknya popularitas negara tersebut di kalangan turis mancanegara, terutama yang tertarik untuk mengunjungi bidang wisata tersebut yang umumnya illegal di banyak negara lainnya. Selain terkenal di kalangan wisatawan, legalisasi industri seks di Belanda juga menarik banyak tenaga kerja asing. Melalui data yang didapatkan oleh Stephen &amp; Carter (2000), sebanya 32% dari pekerja seks di Belanda berasal dari luar wilayah negara tersebut (12% dari negara di Amerika Latin, 8% dari Benua Afrika, dan 4% dari Benua Asia).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/pm0RTacH8pZfqSZm.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: Dokumentasi Pribadi</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSelain mendatangkan keuntungan yang cukup besar, di sisi lain legalisasi industri seks dan aktivitas prostitusi di Belanda juga menimbulkan sebuah konsekuensi. Beberapa contoh yang masih sering ditemui adalah pekerja asing yang masih berusia dibawah umur minimal, yaitu 21 tahun. Warga negara asing yang menjadi pekerja seks di Belanda seringkali tidak terdaftar secara legal dan tidak memiliki lisensi, oleh karena itu banyak dari mereka yang dapat menghindari pajak penghasilan serta check-up kesehatan yang dilaksanakan rutin oleh pemerintah kota (Spapens &amp; Rijken, 2014). Banyak juga dari mereka yang datang ke Belanda menggunakan visa kunjungan wisata, bukan visa untuk bekerja. Hal ini kerap ditemui kepada pekerja asing yang berasal dari negara-negara lain di Benua Eropa. Dalam kurun waktu 3 bulan mereka akan bekerja sebagai pekerja seks, lalu mereka akan meninggalkan Belanda untuk kembali ke negara asal mereka dan dapat menghindari pajak. Walau industri seksnya dinyatakan legal, Belanda juga masih menemui adanya praktik human trafficking. Korban-korban yang akhirnya menjadi pekerja seks illegal tersebut biasanya berasal dari benua Afrika dan Asia yang diiming-imingi motif ekonomi oleh trafficker mereka. Dalam sebuah data yang didapatkan oleh van Wijk et.al. (2010), sebanyak 8% pekerja seks di Amsterdam adalah korban dari human trafficking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMelalui tulisan dan penjelasan diatas, dapat ditarik sebuah kesimpulan bahwa legalisasi industri seks dan aktivitas prostitusi di Belanda masih menimbulkan kekhawatiran di masyarakat dan bagi pemerintah. Walaupun Belanda sudah memiliki sebuah dasar hukum yang melindungi industri tersebut, pelanggaran yang ditemui sejak awal munculnya industri seks pada abad ke-17 masih banyak ditemui juga pada tahun 2018. Sesaat sebelum walking tour yang saya ikuti berakhir, tour guide saya yang berlatar belakang ilmu sejarah mengatakan bahwa industri seks di Belanda memang sudah lebih tertata dan diperhatikan daripada di negara-negara lain yang melegalkan aktivitas yang sama, namun bagaimanapun juga, keistimewaan Red Light District yang menarik banyak turis untuk datang ke Amsterdam juga menarik banyak kesempatan lain bagi para oknum yang tidak bertanggung jawab untuk menemukan sebuah loophole dalam kebijakan tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>REFERENSI<br />\r\nSpapens, Toine &amp; Conny Rijken. 2014.

Diskusi di dalam kelas pun biasanya dapat dengan mudah dihidupkan melalui perbedaan perspektif karena memang perbedaan perspektif tersebut tidak akan menghasilkan satu hal yang sama. Hasilnya tentu diskusi dapat berjalan dengan lebih berwarna dengan adanya perbedaan perspektif. Pada akhirnya, (mungkin) beberapa mahasiswa yang mengamini satu perspektif tertentu, (mungkin) ada pula yang masih mencari perspektif yang cocok bagi dirinya dan (mungkin) ada pula sebagian kecil diantara mereka yang masih bingung. Apakah perbedaan sudut pandang kemudian menjadi hal yang salah? Tentu tidak!

Kemajuan peradaban tersebut kemudian menggiring Negara-negara di dunia untuk belajar pada Amerika Serikat dan Sekutunya dalam berbagai aspek seperti militer, politik, ekonomi dan social. Salah satu yang dipelajari tentunya adalah Bahasa yang dituturkan oleh Amerika Serikat dan Sekutunya (Inggris). Sejak saat itu, penggunaan Bahasa Inggris dalam pertemuan maupun perundingan resmi antar negara baik secara lisan maupun tulisan semakin gencar dilakukan. Penggunaan Bahasa Inggris ini secara tidak langsung menggeser popularitas bahasa lainnya yang dulunya pernah digunakan sebagai bahasa internasional seperti Bahasa Spanyol yang pernah mendominasi melalui penjajahan, Bahasa Latin yang pernah mendominasi melalui Penyebaran Agama Katolik oleh Gereja, ataupun Bahasa Arab yang pernah mendominasi melalui penyebaran Agama Islam. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Kemajuan peradaban yang dimiliki oleh Amerika Serikat dan Sekutunya juga menggiring Negara-negara lain untuk menyerap ilmu pengetahuan dari mereka.

Bahasa dianggap sebagai salah satu sarana komunikasi yang menjembatani banyak pihak agar dapat menyampaikan maksut dan tujuan mereka dengan baik. Untuk itu dibutuhakan satu bahasa yang dapat dipahami secara bersama-sama. Kemampuan menjalin komunikasi yang baik melalui penggunaan bahasa yang sama diharapkan dapat mengurangi potensi konflik.

Jika kita membahas tentang Ideologi Komunis, bahasa yang terpintas di kepala kita tentunya Bahasa Rusia. Hal yang sama juga berlaku pada Ideologi Liberalis yang melekat pada Bahasa Inggris.

Ekspansi yang tidak melulu melalui perang (penaklukan, penjajahan) bisa pula melalui interaksi perdagangan (jual-beli).

Ketika perspektif sudah berbeda maka hal ini tentu akan menghasilkan kesimpulan yang berbeda pula. Perbedaan seperti ini adalah hal yang biasa dalam rumpun ilmu social. Untuk itu ada pandangan tertentu dalam ilmu social yang menganggap kebenaran adalah suatu hal yang relatif. Hal itu bergantung pada sudut pandang mana yang digunakan untuk menganalisis.

Karena itu, membaca buku menjadi hal yang sangat penting bagi mahasiswa untuk mendukung pengetahuannya. Terlebih sebagai mahasiswa Hubungan Internasional, HI-<em>bro</em> dan HI-<em>sis</em> dituntut untuk memperbanyak sumber referensi bacaan. Banyaknya buku referensi dalam mengkaji Hubungan Internasional tentunya akan menyulitkan mahasiswa dalam memilih buku yang tepat. Hal inilah yang sepertinya mengilhami HI-<em>sir</em> yang bernama M. Rosyidin untuk menulis buku terbarunya dengan judul &ldquo;20 Buku Hubungan Internasional Paling Berpengaruh&rdquo;. Pada kesempatan kali ini, hubunganinternasional.id akan mewawancarai M. Rosyidin yang merupakan dosen di Program Studi Hubungan Internasional FISIP Universitas Diponegoro untuk mengetahui lebih jauh karyanya. Berikut adalah hasil wawancaranya:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>hubunganinternasional.id (hi.id):</strong> <strong><em>Apa hal yang menjadi latar belakang dari penulisan buku ini?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nM. Rosyidin (M.R): Ketika mengajar mata kuliah Teori HI, saya mendapati mahasiswa cukup kesulitan membaca karya-karya babon yang sering menjadi rujukan. Padahal gagasan dalam karya-karya itu sangat penting, tidak saja karena menentukan perkembangan studi HI selama hampir 100 tahun tetapi juga penting untuk mahasiswa yang akan melakukan penelitian, misalnya menulis paper dan skripsi. Saya prihatin dengan situasi itu. Ditambah lagi kenyataan bahwa banyak mahasiswa masih mengutip dari sumber-sumber tak kredibel dari internet untuk karya akademik mereka. Jadi saya berpikir bagaimana supaya mahasiswa mampu memahami inti gagasan dari karya-karya babon tersebut. Tentu saja buku ini tidak saya anjurkan sebagai buku rujukan utama. Buku ini hanyalah teks pengantar ke pemikiran-pemikiran kunci dalam HI. Setelah membaca buku ini saya berharap mahasiswa tidak berpuas diri dan semakin ingin tahu lebih dalam dengan membaca karya aslinya (first hand).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/Qfax-N1LHkxkNoom.jpg\" style=\"height:471px; width:680px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image:</em> Dokumentasi pribadi M. Rosyidin</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>hi.id:</strong> <strong><em>Mengapa menurut anda, 20 buku yang ada dalam list tersebut layak untuk dipelajari oleh mahasiswa Hubungan Internasional?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nM.R: Saya sebetulnya agak ragu 20 adalah jumlah yang ideal untuk buku &lsquo;paling berpengaruh&rsquo;. Tentu ada banyak buku berpengaruh dalam kajian HI. Namun menentukan angka 20 semata-mata dimaksudkan untuk alasan praktis saja. Ada dua alasan mengapa saya memilih angka 20. Pertama, jumlah 20 menurut saya cukup memadai untuk mengulas satu-persatu karya-karya babon itu secara detil tanpa melebihi batas jumlah halaman yang proporsional untuk ukuran kemampuan membaca mahasiswa Indonesia. Saya menyadari betul efek media digital terhadap batas kemampuan membaca mahasiswa Indonesia. Paling-paling mahasiswa &lsquo;jaman now&rsquo; hanya betah tak lebih dari 1 jam dalam sekali sesi membaca. Menulis buku dengan ketebalan yang pas merupakan tantangan tersendiri bagi penulis. Oleh sebab itu, saya mencoba mempertimbangkan faktor ini. Alasan kedua adalah saya mencoba membatasi diri pada karya yang benar-benar penting untuk dipelajari mahasiswa HI tingkat dasar. Itulah sebabnya dalam daftar saya tidak banyak karya-karya aliran kritis/pospositivis (kecuali aliran feminisme) yang menuntut pemahaman akan filsafat yang kuat. Saya cukup ragu dengan kapasitas intelektual mahasiswa sekarang untuk mencerna karya-karya filsafat yang mendasari munculnya aliran kritis/pospositivis dalam HI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>hi.id: <em>Anda berpendapat bahwasanya 20 buku tersebut merupakan buku-buku yang paling berpengaruh dalam Hubungan Internasional. Bisa jelaskan maksud dari &ldquo;paling berpengaruh&rdquo;?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nM.R: Paling berpengaruh mengandung dua pengertian. Pertama, berpengaruh dalam hal akademik. Artinya, sebuah pemikiran lebih diorientasikan untuk membangun perspektif teoritis tertentu untuk menjawab problem-problem keilmuan. Perspektif teoritis ini kemudian menjadi panduan dalam melakukan riset. Cirinya hanya satu: banyak dikutip dalam karya akademik. Saya tidak punya alat untuk mengukur banyak atau sedikitnya jumlah kutipan. Namun, dengan pengamatan kasar sudah dapat disimpulkan karya mana yang paling banyak dikutip dibanding lainnya. Kedua, berpengaruh dalam hal praktis. Banyak karya yang mempengaruhi praktisi politik dalam merumuskan kebijakan. Buku-buku yang mengandung resep kebijakan cenderung dibaca kalangan praktisi. Dari 20 buku HI paling berpengaruh, hanya sedikit yang benar-benar mempengaruhi kebijakan. Selebihnya buku akademik yang dipelajari di balik dinding kelas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>hi.id:</strong> <strong><em>Indikator yang anda gunakan dalam menentukan buku tersebut berpengaruh?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nM.R: Sudah saya jelaskan di atas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>hi.id</strong>: <strong><em>Salah satu buku yang anda sebut paling berpengaruh di dalam tulisan anda adalah Politics among Nations karya H.J Morghentau. Bagaimana pendapat anda tentang pentingnya mahasiswa Hubungan Internasional untuk membaca buku ini? Dan bagaimana relevansi dari buku tersebut dengan kondisi dunia internasional saat ini?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nM.R: Buku Politics among Nations harus diakui merupakan buku wajib baca bagi seluruh mahasiswa HI. Meskipun buku tersebut lebih condong ke sejarah diplomasi internasional, esensi pemikirannya sangat jelas bernuansa realis. Buku itu penting karena sejarah memberikan pelajaran penting bagi praktik hubungan luar negeri. Di samping itu, pemikiran realis yang dikemukakan Morgenthau sudah terlanjur menjadi semacam &lsquo;ideologi&rsquo; bagi banyak penstudi HI dan kalangan praktisi. Seolah-olah menjadi mahasiswa HI itu harus menjadi &lsquo;realis&rsquo;. Padahal banyak yang hanya sekedar tahu gagasan realis dari sumber &lsquo;katanya&rsquo;, bukan hasil dari pembacaan yang intensif. Akibatnya timbul salah paham (atau sesat pikir) tentang esensi ajaran realisme politik itu seperti apa sebenarnya. Terkait pertanyaan kedua, buku itu akan tetap relevan sekalipun dunia sudah banyak berubah. Alasannya adalah argumen realisme Morgenthau sangat kokoh karena berdiri di atas pondasi pengalaman sejarah negara-negara selama ratusan tahun. Bagaimanapun, pengalaman adalah guru terbaik. Prinsip hubungan luar negeri yang diadopsi negara-negara di dunia dewasa ini masih cocok dengan tipikal negara-negara di abad-19 dan 20. Bahwa buku ini banyak kekurangan sudah pasti. Akan tetapi sebuah gagasan besar cenderung tak lekang oleh waktu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>hi.id:</strong> <strong><em>Menurut pendapat anda, bagaimana 20 buku tersebut dapat mendukung pengetahuan mahasiswa dalam mempelajari Hubungan Internasional?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nM.R: Pertama, buku ini membantu mahasiswa mengenal mahakarya-mahakarya penting dalam studi HI. Tidak banyak mahasiswa (apalagi level S1) yang tahu buku HI mana yang perlu dibaca kalau tidak direkomendasikan dosennya. Sebagai langkah awal, mengenal adalah lebih baik daripada tidak sama sekali. Kedua, buku ini membantu memudahkan mahasiswa menyerap gagasan inti dari mahakarya-mahakarya itu. Buku-buku yang masuk daftar buku ini rata-rata sangat tebal dan menguras energi untuk membacanya. Dengan pertimbangan generasi milenial bukanlah kutu buku (kutu gadget?) sebagaimana generasi terdahulu, buku ini setidaknya membuat mereka memahami esensi dari setiap pemikiran. Ketiga, buku ini mempermudah mahasiswa dalam mencari asumsi-asumsi dasar yang akan mereka pakai sebagai kerangka analisis dalam menyusun karya akademik. Analisis yang bagus ditopang oleh pondasi teoritis yang kuat. Jika mereka kesulitan menemukan di mana letak asumsi dasar sebuah teori dalam buku setebal 500-700 an halaman, mereka bisa mencarinya dengan mudah di buku ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>hi.id:</strong> <strong><em>Diantara 20 buku tersebut, adakah yang menjadi favorit anda? Mengapa?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nM.R: Buku Social Theory of International Politics karya Alex Wendt. Saya memperoleh kopi buku ini dari kakak tingkat saya di S1 dulu dengan harga 20 ribu. Saya langsung tenggelam di dalamnya dan menekuni buku ini selama 4 tahun sebelum benar-benar memahaminya. Kalau dihitung-hitung, mungkin saya sudah membaca buku ini puluhan kali dan sekalipun tak pernah merasa bosan. Ibaratnya, buku ini sudah menjadi &lsquo;kitab suci&rsquo; bagi saya. Bagaimana tidak, buku ini mengubah cara pandang saya tantang HI. Saya dulunya seorang realis fanatik. Setelah membaca buku ini saya murtad dari realis dan mentahbiskan diri menjadi penganut konstruktivis hingga sekarang. Lebih dari itu, saya menganggap Alex Wendt sebagai mentor konstruktivis saya. Saat mengerjakan skripsi lebih dari 10 tahun lalu, Alex adalah &lsquo;pembimbing ketiga&rsquo; saya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>hi.id:</strong> <strong><em>Buku ini merupakan karya ke-6 anda sebagai penulis. Boleh share sedikit pengalaman menarik anda sebagai seorang penulis?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nM.R: Menjadi penulis itu berarti menjadi pertapa sekaligus martir. Menulis adalah bekerja dalam kesendirian dan kesunyian. Saya sudah menulis sejak S1. Kalau dikatakan menulis adalah hobi, itu betul sekali. Menulis butuh energi yang besar. Jika tidak punya passion maka sulit sekali seseorang menjadi penulis. Saya menulis tanpa motif apapun kecuali membagi pengetahuan yang saya miliki ini kepada orang banyak. Kalaupun ada imbalan materi maupun penghargaan ini hanya efek samping. Semua karya saya tidak mendapatkan sponsor finansial dari siapapun. Semua saya tulis sendiri. Tentu bantuan pemikiran, saran, kritik, perbaikan dan kontribusi-kontribusi lainnya datang dari banyak teman dan kolega. Setelah passion, syarat kedua menjadi penulis adalah disiplin. Maksudnya harus pandai mengatur waktu. Setiap orang punya ritme kehidupan yang berbeda-beda. Tetapi semuanya punya jatah waktu yang sama; 24 jam. Tinggal ditemukan saja kapan waktu paling pas buat menulis. Kalau saya jam produktif saya adalah antara jam 6 sampai jam 10 pagi. Kemudian jam 9 sampai jam 11 malam. Kalau sudah menulis saya kadang lupa makan. Bahkan dulu pernah sewaktu menulis buku pertama saya (The Power of Ideas) saya sampai kena gejala tipes. Hal itu karena saya menulis karya sepanjang 55.000 kata itu kurang dari sebulan, lupa makan, lupa istirahat, dan jomblo pula hahaha. Kalau sudah ketemu jam produktifnya, syarat ketiga adalah fokus dan konsisten. Memulai kata pertama dalam menulis adalah persoalan gampang. Yang susah adalah menjaga ritme itu sampai kata terakhir. Terkadang di tengah jalan kita stuck, atau writer&rsquo;s block. Itu biasa. Yang penting kita tidak terlalu lama membiarkan tulisan kita terbengkalai. Kalau naskah sudah jadi, syarat terakhir menjadi penulis adalah tidak berekspektasi terlalu berlebihan. Kadang kita sulit menerima kenyataan tulisan yang sudah susah payah kita buat ditolak penerbit atau editor untuk jurnal atau koran. Saya sendiri sudah kenyang dengan penolakan, bahkan hingga detik ini. Saya sih sudah kebal dengan hal-hal begituan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/1la8iTJwMwAjiPCV.jpg\" style=\"height:515px; width:380px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: Dokumentasi pribadi M. Rosyidin</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>hi.id:</strong> <strong><em>Pertanyaan terakhir, adakah Pesan yang ingin anda sampaikan kepada para pembaca melalui karya anda seperti maksud dan tujuan dari ditulisnya buku tersebut?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nM.R: Membaca adalah harga mati. Sekarang ini saya melihat adanya fenomena yang saya namakan &lsquo;paradox of plenty&rsquo; dalam dunia pendidikan. Maksudnya, di satu sisi tingkat kesejahteraan ekonomi mahasiswa makin meningkat. Tengok saja tempat parkir kampus. Atau lihat saja merk gadget yang mereka bawa. Semuanya mengindikasikan kemampuan ekonomi yang di atas rata-rata. Tetapi di sisi lain, kemampuan intelektual jeblok. Bukan lantaran mereka &lsquo;lemah otak&rsquo; alias kurang pandai. Sebaliknya, mereka rata-rata dari kalangan berada yang asupan nutrisinya terjamin sehingga otaknya cemerlang. Hanya saja, kemalasan yang membuat kemampuan intelektual tadi melemah. Mereka lebih suka utak-atik smart phone ketimbang membaca. Jika hal itu dibiarkan berlarut-larut, kualitas pemikiran generasi muda kita akan tertinggal jauh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>hi.id:</strong> <strong><em>Terimakasih atas waktunya. Kami tunggu karya anda yang berikutnya</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nM.R: Terima kasih dan selamat membaca.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBuku ini layaknya sebuah peta harta karun yang akan membawa pembacanya untuk menemukan harta karun lainnya. Harta karun yang dimaksud adalah ilmu pengetahuan dalam Hubungan Internasional yang akan membuat para pemiliknya memiliki kekuasaan (wawasan). Jika dalam sebuah peperangan kita tentu harus mempersiapkan diri dengan baik (berlatih), maka dalam belajar kita pun harus melakukan hal yang sama (belajar). Terinspirasi perkataan John Rambo dalam film First Blood 1 &ldquo;Let it go, or I&rsquo;ll give you a war you won&rsquo;t believe&rdquo; saya pun mencoba mengkreasikan versi saya.

(7,22,1,'Wawancara di Balik Layar Jurnal Hubungan Internasional Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta','',NULL,'<p>Publikasi memiliki arti penting bagi akademisi. Hal ini tidak terlepas dari salah satu kewajiban yang harus dipenuhi oleh akademisi khususnya dosen dalam hal kepangkatan. Apalagi jika tulisan tersebut dipublikasikan di jurnal bereputasi dan terakreditasi baik di level nasional ataupun internasional tentunya menjadi tantangan dan kebanggaan tersendiri dari akademisi. Oleh karena itu wajar jika banyak dosen yang mencoba men-submit tulisannya untuk kemudian dipublikasikan di jurnal bergengsi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nKewajiban untuk melakukan publikasi ini juga dianggap hal yang penting oleh kebanyakan perguruan tinggi di dunia. Bahkan jumlah publikasi di jurnal yang bergengsi menjadi salah satu tolak ukur untuk melihat kualitas dari sebuah perguruan tinggi. Mengingat pentingnya memiliki publikasi, wajar saja jika perguruan tinggi juga berupaya untuk mengelola jurnalnya sendiri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTentu sudah banyak sekali cerita keluh dan kesah para dosen sekalian dalam menyelesaikan sebuah artikel, serta tak lupa pula keluh dan kesah para dosen sekalian menanti tulisan tersebut dipublikasikan oleh jurnal yang dituju. Akan tetapi mungkin tidak banyak yang mengetahui cerita tentang &ldquo;di balik layar&rdquo; pengelolaan sebuah jurnal. Melalui tulisan ini hubunganinternasional.id mencoba untuk menggali sedikit cerita dari salah seorang HI-<em>sir</em> bernama Ade Ma&rsquo;ruf Wirasenjaya. Beliau merupakan dosen yang mengajar di Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta (UMY) sekaligus pengelola Jurnal Hubungan Internasional UMY. Tulisan ini ditujukan untuk memberikan gambaran kepada para pembaca tentang tantangan yang dihadapi oleh seorang pengelola jurnal juga saran-saran yang sekiranya bermanfaat dalam pengembangan pengelolaan jurnal di perguruan tinggi anda. Berikut adalah hasil wawancaranya:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Hubunganinternasional.id (hi.id): Sudah berapa lama anda menjadi pengelola Jurnal Hubungan Internasional (JHI) UMY?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ade Maruf Wirasenjaya (A.M.W): Sekitar 13 tahun</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id: Apa yang melatarbelakangi pembentukan JHI UMY ketika itu?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: Pada mulanya JHI UMY dibuat untuk diseminasi hasil riset dan pemikiran staf pengajar di lingkungan Departemen HI UMY. Jurnal yang khusus menampung kajian HI juga masih terbatas. Pada konteks yang lebih strategis, juga didororong oleh keinginan supaya Jurusan HI UMY yang nota-bene kampus swasta memiliki &ldquo;nilai lebih&rdquo; dengan adanya penerbitan jurnal yang serius.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>:</strong><em><strong> Bisa tolong anda ceritakan bagaimana tantangan yang anda dan tim hadapi ketika awal berjalannya jurnal tersebut?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: Pertama, sejak dulu dunia jurnal memang bukan &ldquo;dunia proyek&rdquo; yang tidak banyak sisi manisnya sehingga tidak &ldquo;mengundang semut untuk berkerumun&rdquo;. Jurnal dari dulu memang arena yang sepi, apalagi membuatnya bisa&nbsp; kontinyu dan memiliki standar. Kedua, mencari penulis tidaklah susah, tetapi mencari tulisan yang bagus agak itu yang jadi masalah. Ditambah mentalitas akademisi di kita yang merasa senior &ndash; dari sisi usia, kepangkatan dan gelar -- yang kadang susah untuk menerima koreksi dan review dari orang-orang muda. Tantangan ketiga, mencari tim kerja jurnal yang mau berkeringat di ruang sepi, yang memiliki visi dan gairah yang sama, juga merupakan tantangan yang lain. Pada tahap-tahap awal, kami harus mencari naskah sendiri, mengeditnya dari tulisan-tulisan yang masih memakai bahasa dan struktur riset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>:</strong><em><strong> Publikasi pertama, bagaimana perasaannya ketika itu?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: Publikasi pertama seingat saya tahun 2003. Waktu itu kami tidak memikirkan soal akreditasi, yang penting terbit secara ajeg. Perasaannya biasa-biasa saja, karena memiliki jurnal bagi institusi akademik adalah hal yang lumrah --&nbsp; teramat lumrah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>:</strong><em><strong> Berapa tahun yang dibutuhkan JHI untuk bisa terakreditasi nasional?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: Kami baru berani mengajukan akreditasi tahun 2015 dan alhamdulillah bisa langsung diterima, tetapi prosesnya sangat panjang. Tidak langsung diterima, karena beberapa instrumen belum sesuai dengan ketentuan. Kami tidak begitu pede maju akreditasi karena banyak hal-hal teknis yang terus terang masih kami abaikan sehubungan ketiadaan tenaga. Kami terbit tidak sesuai jadwal sebelum maju akreditasi. Proses review hanya dilakukan oleh mereka yang sempat. Dengan iklim seperti itu, kami cukup tahu diri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTetapi beruntung pada waktu-waktu belakangan, pihak universitas dan jurusan memberi banyak sekali kesempatan dan fasilitas. Kami mulai mengikuti workshop-workshop pengelolaan jurnal yang diadakan Dikti. Waktu itu yang paling sering kami ikuti adalah workshop yang diadakan di Universitas Negeri Malang. Bahkan kami tak segan-segan membawa jurnal beserta layout dan hasil editing untuk minta direview secara langsung oleh reviewer agar kami tahu kesalahannya pada&nbsp; aspek mana. Rupanya banyak hal minor pada aspek teknis dan tata kelola naskah. Pelan-pelan kami perbaiki sehingga tata laksana kerja jurnal dan tupoksi masing-masing desk terus kami benahi. Memang modalnya harus &ldquo;tebal muka&rdquo; dan tidak malu untuk direview orang-orang yang memiliki kapasitas melakukannya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>:</strong><em><strong> Apa saja syaratnya mendapatkan akreditasi nasional?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W:&nbsp; Saat JHI UMY maju akreditasi, instrumennnya sudah berganti. Memang pengelola jurnal harus terus mengupdate info tentang regulasi dan instrumen akreditasi terkini. Waktu itu syaratnya harus terbit 6 edisi dan komposisi naskah 30-70 (internal-eksternal), harus melibatkan reviewer eksternal, ada bukti-bukti blind-review, ada bukti-bukti komunikasi antara pengelola-penulis-reviewer, kwitansi dan bukti pengiriman, cetak-lepas, dan lain-lain. Aspek lain juga penting untuk diperhatikan, sejak nama yang sesuai dengan selingkung akademik, tata letak, desain dan perwajahan. Intinya, semua aspek dinilai dengan bobot&nbsp; penilaian yang berbeda-beda.<br />\r\nSetelah saya bertemu beberapa kolega di berbagai kampus, sebenarnya semua punya kapasitas. Yang berbeda mungkin belum ada dukungan institusi, juga belum ketemu semangat kolektif dari beberapa orang untuk menghidupkan jurnal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>:</strong><em><strong> Bagaimana cerita di balik proses akreditasi JHI UMY?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: Tidak bisa kita mengerjakan jurnal sendirian, itu inti ceritanya. Tidak ada superman dalam menggarap jurnal ilmiah. Untuk akreditasi di UMY, kami dimudahkan karena sejak lima tahun terakhir dari pihak kampus punya policy dan komitmen yang jelas dan sistematis dalam mengelola jurnal. Kampus memberi insentif dan treatment khusus, disamping itu semua pengelolaan jurnal di UMY berada di bawah payung Divisi Penerbitan dan Publikasi Lembaga Penelitian (Lemlit). Jadi, jurnal di UMY sudah punya bahasa desain dan perwajahan yang sama, sehingga kami pada&nbsp; level pengelola tinggal menyiapkan tim kerja yang berjibaku pada konten dan pengembangan manajemen redaksional. UMY juga punya kebijakan yang cukup memadai dalam roadmaping pengembangan jurnal di kampus. Pengajuan akreditasi juga dilakukan satu pintu, lewat LP3M Divisi Publikasi. Pendanaan juga sangat baik. Kami tinggal mengajukan program pengembangan, jika dirasa output dan targetnya jelas, universitas akan memberi dukunganpenuh. Semua itu tentu saja memudahkan dan menyemangati kami.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/SbNjreh2g9WWny8_.jpg\" style=\"height:267px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image:</em> Dokumentasi Pribadi Ade Ma&#39;ruf Wirasenjaya</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHanya saja, dalam instruemen akreditasi terkini, keterlibatan pihak eksternal seperti mitra bebestari memberi kontribusi cukup besar terhadap seluruh unsur penilaian. JHI memanfaatkan dosen-dosen yang pernah berksekolah di luar negeri atau memiliki kolega reviewer di luar negeri maupun di kampus lain untuk terlibat sebagai reviewer. Sepertinya pola ini cukup standar dilakukan oleh hampir semua pengelola jurnal. Kami juga memanfaatkan dosen-dosen tamu yang mengajar di UMY untuk dilibatkan dalam proses review. Ada yang bisa, ada yang nggak. Saya senang karena di komunitas pengelola jurnal HI kami banyak dibantu oleh kolega-kolega, baik sebagai reviewer maupun sebagai partner dalam pengembangan JHI ke depan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>: </strong><em><strong>Perjuangan anda dalam mengelola jurnal tentu tidak mudah, dan tentu ada dalam satu momen di mana semua orang berada dalam titik terendahnya atau titik terjenuhnya. Kapan momen itu pernah datang menghampiri anda dan bagaimana anda mengatasinya?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: Benar, sering sekali mengalami kejenuhan. Mengelola jurnal itu butuh energi dan passion. Kita tidak bisa memakai logika rational choice dalam mengelola dan mengembangkan jurnal. Kita mungkin harus menggunakan passionate choice perspective untuk menjelaskan mengapa ada orang yang masih mau mengelola jurnal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nJHI ini sudah kami rawat bertahun-tahun, masak ditinggalkan begitu saja. Jurnal memang terbit enam bulan sekali, tetapi kerjanya, setiap hari. Apalagi&nbsp; saya sadar, menulis jurnal bagi akademisi kita sebagian besar karena dorongan pragmatis. Kadang ada tuntutan para penulis untuk segera cepat naskahnya diterbitkan, padahal kami harus mencari reviewer dan kadang butuh waktu lama. Ada mereka yang paham, ada juga yang tidak, yang bisanya cuma misuh dan menggerutu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nKejenuhan berikutnya begini: mereka yang nulis di jurnal dapat kredensi akademik yang tinggi, juga dapat insentif yang besar dari institusinya. Sementara pengelola jurnal belum mendapat apresiasi. Tetapi bagaimanapun, sudah terlanjur &ldquo;gila&rdquo; ya sudah. Toh di waktu-waktu belakangan, mulai ada sisi terang juga yang tersedia bagi pengelola jurnal, seperti berbagai skema insentif pengembangan dari Dikti dan dari institusi (kampus). Makanya saya usul, bagi pengelola jurnal yang jurnalnya sudah terakreditasi, ada kompensasi 2 SKS. Dengan cara itu mengelola jurnal tidak lagi menjadi kerja voluntaristik, tetapi professional. Pejabat struktural saja cuma kerja main WA di rapat kerja dapat insentif, masak editor jurnal yang kerjanya nyari reviewer, kontak penulis,&nbsp; menata tulisan, bahkan kadang hingga posting jurnal, tidak mendapat insentif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nKejenuhan lain sering muncul karena kami kerap harus mengganti admin atau manajer jurnal. Tidak mudah mencari orang yang bisa dengan tekun memelototi workflow dan juga merawat komunikasi dengan para reviewer dan penulis. Para admin dan manajer jurnal kadang kami ambil dari fresh graduater yang menunggu jeda untuk sekolah lanjut. Bisa dipahami karena memang tidak ada anggaran yang memadai untuk meng-hire manajer atau admin jurnal. Ini menjadi agenda lain bagi pihak kampus dalam merekrut pegawai non-dosen, yakni menempatkan beberapa orang untuk diproyeksikan sebagai pengelola jurnal.&nbsp; Semua itu kadang dikerjakan juga oleh para pemimpin redaksi jurnal seperti saya dan kadang keteteran.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>:</strong><em><strong> Upaya yang anda dan tim lakukan telah berhasil membuat JHI UMY terakreditasi di level nasional. Segala tantangan tentunya menjadi lebih mudah sekarang?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: Setelah terakreditasi memang ada perubahan besar. Itu bisa dipahami mengingat sebelumnya hanya rekan dari Unair yang sudah akreditasi. Dengan demikian, JHI menambah outlet bagi para dosen untuk mempublikasikan tulisan mereka di jurnal yang terakreditasi.<br />\r\nDari sisi pencarian naskah, sekarang kami menerima naskah rata-rata 5 naskah per bulan, jumlah yang amt signifikan disbanding sebelumnya. Ditolong beberapa compulsory policy dari&nbsp; kampus yang menyelenggarakan jenjang S2 dan S3 yang mewajibkan submit di jurnal terakreditasi, jumlah naskah saat ini relatif gampang dicari. Apalagi dengan aturan kepangkatan akademik yang makin ketat, yang mensyaratkan publikasi di jurnal terakreditasi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDari sisi reviewer juga relatif mudah. Teman-teman di Jurusan HI se-Indonesia &ndash; khususnya para pengelola jurnal &ndash; sudah makin paham pentingnya kolaborasi dan jaringan. Sedang proses cetak tidak terlalu problematis karena saat ini Dikti mulai mendorong migrasi ke jurnal online (OJS). Versi cetak biasanya kami buat untuk dikirim ke penulis atau untuk kebutuhan souvennnir bagi tamu universitas. Intinya, saya kerap kali sampaikan di bebarapa forum workshop, antara diajukan akreditasi dan tidak diajukan akre, mengelola jurnal itu sama lelahnya dan sama ongkosnya, jadi kenapa nggak sekalian ajukan akre saja. Semakin banyak jurnal terakreditasi, semakin banyak outlet bagi akademisi HI untuk publikasi karya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nKami juga mulai menetapkan publication fee bagi yang tulisannya dimuat. Dulu kami membayar penulis, kini penulis harus bayar , tentu saja setelah dinyatakan layak muat oleh reviewer dan editor. Tak jarang publication fee ini disalahpahami oleh sejumlah kalangan sebagai komersialisasi. Kami pernah dikomplain penulis dan tidak mau bayar. Ya sudah, daripada ngotot kami biarkan saja. Dia tidak tahu bagaimana susahnya mengelola jurnal di sini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSudah saatnya kami memberi penghargaan pada editor dan section editors. Juga pada admin yang sehari-hari berkutat mengurusi lalu-lintas naskah. Kami juga memberi insentif untuk reviewer eksternal. Kami ingin menghargai orang-orang yang telah mendedikasikan waktu, pikiran dan sekaligus mentalnya untuk&nbsp; membesarkan JHI. Nah, uang dari publication fee itu kami gunakan untuk hal-hal yang saya sebutkan tadi. Selebihnya untuk pengembangan system, ekspedisi dan juga untuk berbagai keperluan. Uang dari institusi kami gunakan untuk dana rutin penerbitan seperti cetak dan berbagai kegiatan. Adanya publication fee cukup membantu kami menjalankan manajemen redaksi maupun kelembagaan jurnal. Taka da aspek komersial di situ karena toh para penulis juga akan mendapatkan insentif dari institusinya jika tulisan mereka dimuat, baik insentif materiil maupun yang non-materiil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>:<em> Proyeksi ke depan dari JHI UMY?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: Roadmap JHI disiapkan untuk menjadi jurnal internasional. Kami sudah diundang presentasi oleh pimpinan UMY tentang rencana ke depan. Kami sekarang satu-satunya jurnal HI dari Indonesia yang masuk Asean Citation Index (ACI) dan juga green thick di DOAJ (yang setara dengan jurnal internasional). Sekarang kami sedang membenahi resources terutrama dari tim editor&nbsp; supaya kuat, juga menambah jejaring dan juga melibatkan lebih banyak reviewer dari berbagai negara. Dalam dua tahun ke depan, kami berharap JHI sudah bisa didaftarkan ke lembaga index yang lebih tinggi seperti Scopus. Meskipun begitu, kami tak terlalu terbebani dan&nbsp; terburu-buru. Ada banyak factor teknis dan non teknis yang perlu disiapkan. Sejak beberapa tahun terakhir, kami sering mengundang beberapa pihak untuk membantu menyiapkan JHI menjadi jurnal internasional yang terindeks di lembaga yang bereputasi. Rasanya, JHI akan mengarah ke sana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>:</strong><em><strong> Dengan semua pengalaman yang anda miliki, tentu pernah beberapa kali diundang terkait sharing terkait JHI ini dengan para kolega dari perguruan tinggi lain? Apa pesan yang anda sampaikan kepada mereka?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: Mengelola jurnal itu, sekali lagi, kerja tim. Dulu seorang professor yang sering jadi reviewer jurnal kasih nasihat begini: jika kamu cuma berdua apalagi sendirian garap jurnal, betapapun hebatnya kamu, mending nggak usah dilanjut. Capek iya, jurnalnya jadi nggak. Dia kemudian memberi nasihat setidaknya minimal 5 orang yang &ldquo;punya kegilaan yang sama&rdquo;. Mereka haruslah kolega-kolega yang punya visi dan impian yang sama.Syukur JHI memilikinya.Berikutnya adalah dukungan institusi, yakni dari level departemen dan dari universitas. Tanpa dukungan institusi, menerbitkan jurnal adalah omong kosong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/4V7KM_YwMkICExpR.jpg\" style=\"height:444px; width:250px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: Dokumentasi Pribadi Ade Ma&#39;ruf Wirasenjaya</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSetelah saya beberapa kali diundang training dan workshop, saya berkesimpulan bahwa dalam selingkung HI, kapasitas bukan perkara serius. Ada banyak akademisi yang per individu begitu hebat di setiap kampus. Tetapi nampaknya energy akademiknya belum mengalami kanalisasi dan diproyeksikan untuk mengembangkan jurnal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>:</strong><em><strong> Berapa banyak jurnal Studi Hubungan Internasional di Indonesia yang terakreditasi nasional saat ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: Setahu saya sudah empat dengan sistem clustering indeks Sinta sekarang, yakni JHI UMY, Global dan Strategi Unair, Global UI, dari Universitas Andalas dan dari teman-teman Unpar Bandung (sedang pengajuan).<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>:<em> Apa hal menurut anda paling fundamental dalam mengelola jurnal yang juga hal tersebut harus dimiliki oleh pengelola jurnal lainnya?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: <em>Passion</em>, kompetensi dan persistensi merupakan tiga kombinasi yang dibutuhkan untuk mengelola jurnal. Dengan passion kita tidak terlalu pragmatis dan menempatkan ruang kerja jurnal sebagai studio dan sanggar untuk berkarya. Dengan kompetensi jurnal kita dipercaya orang. Dengan persistensi kita bisa menaklukan tuntutan-tuntutan administratif dan teknis yang selama ini kita bayangkan begitu rumit padahal tidak rumit-rumit amat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>: </strong><em><strong>Jika ada pembaca yang tertarik untuk submit artikel di JHI, boleh share link dan CP?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: Untuk submit artikel di JHI bisa dikirim melalui email jurnalhi@umy.ac.id atau <a href=\"http://journal.umy.ac.id/index.php/jhi/\">journal.umy.ac.id/index.php/jhi/</a> sedangkan untuk CP bisa langsung menghubungi saya melalui email adewirasenjaya@hotmail.co.id</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong>HI.id</strong></em><strong>:</strong><em><strong> Terimakasih Pak Ade </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.M.W: Camacama</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Demikian wawancara yang hubunganinternasional.id dengan Pak Ade Ma&#39;ruf Wirasenjaya. semoga dapat menginspirasi para pembaca dan para kolega sekalian, khususnya para pengelola jurnal.

(8,24,1,'Wawancara Buku Strategi China Merebut Status Superpower','',NULL,'<p><em>Superpower</em>! Banyak Negara tentu mendambakan status ini. Perkara itu berhasil di jawab dengan baik oleh Amerika Serikat yang telah berhasil menjadi Negara <em>S</em><em>uperpower</em> dan menancapkan pengaruhnya di level internasional. Dominasinya telah berjalan selama puluhan tahun pasca Perang Dunia II. Kekuasaan Amerika Serikat pun kemudian menjadi semakin tak terbendung pasca runtuhnya Uni Soviet yang kemudian membuat Amerika Serikat secara otomatis menjadi Negara <em>Superpower</em> di level internasional. Akan tetapi bukan berarti pertarungan antar Negara untuk merebut status <em>Superpower</em> kemudian terhenti. Layaknya pertarungan di ring tinju, Amerika Serikat pun akhirnya menemukan penantang terbarunya. China muncul ke permukaan dan dianggap sebagai kandidat <em>Superpower</em> baru menggantikan Amerika Serikat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nChina saat ini menjadi salah satu negara yang paling banyak diperbincangkan di dunia internasional. Salah satu yang paling mencolok tentunya peningkatan kekuatan ekonominya yang terus mengalami peningkatan setiap tahunnya. Tidak hanya di situ, perusahaan China pun sangat agresif untuk melakukan ekspansi bisnisnya ke berbagai penjuru dunia. Hal ini (ekonomi) merupakan salah satu indikator untuk melihat bagaimana kekuatan China meningkat dengan luar biasa. China berhasil mengganti tampilan mereka dari Negara berkembang yang butuh bantuan (hutang) menjadi Negara dengan kekuatan ekonomi luar baisa yang memberikan bantuan (hutang). China tentunya tidak ingin menyianyiakan kesempatan emas ini untuk membangun negaranya agar lebih kuat dan modern. Untuk mewujudkan hal tersebut, China melakukan serangkaian strategi baik di dalam maupun di luar negeri untuk memperkuat dirinya. Tentunya hal ini membutuhkan sebuah strategi jangka panjang yang terarah dengan baik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPembahasan tentang sepak terjang China menjadi Negara <em>Superpower</em> ini dituangkan dalam sebuah buku karangan Prof. Dr. Bambang Cipto. M.A dengan judul &ldquo;Strategi China Merebut Status Superpower&rdquo; HubunganInternal.id mencoba menghubungi Prof. Bambang yang juga merupakan salah satu Guru Besar yang mengajar di Program Studi Hubungan Internasional Fakultas Ilmu Sosial dan Ilmu Politik Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta untuk bertanya beberapa hal tentang buku yang beliau tulis. Berikut adalah hasil wawancaranya:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HubunganInternasional.id (hi.id): Tolong jelaskan, apa yang melatarbelakangi Anda menulis buku ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof. Dr. Bambang Cipto. M.A (Prof. B.C): Sekitar tahun 2002, kalau nggak salah ingat, saya pernah diundang Kemenlu untuk sebuah seminar tentang China di sebuah hotel di Jakarta. Pada waktu seingat saya Dubes China untuk Indonesia menolak pernyataan saya bahwa kelak tahun 2017-an China akan menjadi <em>Superpower</em> berdasarkan berbagai sumber yang saya baca saat itu. Inilah salah satu inspirasi untuk menulis buku tentang China. Disamping itu literature Barat tentang strategi China juga nyaris belum muncul atau saya mungkin belum menemukan sehingga ditulis sendiri untuk memenuhi kebutuhan bacaan bermutu dan trendi bagi adik2 mahasiswa kita.<img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/1PedQcKWQGFkJAqU.jpg\" style=\"height:533px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: Dokumentasi Pribadi Prof. Dr. Bambang Cipto, M.A</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong>Hi.id: Mengapa China perlu mengambil status sebagai Negara Superpower? Mengapa tidak membiarkan Amerika Serikat saja yang memegang kendali tersebut?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof. B.C: Sebetulnya kemungkinan China menjadi <em>Superpower</em> pernah diprediksi oleh Napoleon yang menyatakan bahwa <em>&ldquo;China is a sleeping Giant. Let China sleep because for she wakes she will shake the world.&rdquo;</em> (Quand la Chine s&rsquo;eveillera, ie monde tremblera). Sementara itu Sun Tzu pernah mengatakan bahwa <em>&quot;if you know your the enemy and you know your self, you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.&quot;</em> China juga berkali-kali menghadapi percobaan Barat dan Jepang untuk menguasai negara raksasa tersebut. Secara psikologis sejarah ini ikut membentuk mind set <em>Superpower</em> dalam bentuk para elit politik China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Hi.id: Buku yang Anda tulis menyebut sejumlah strategi yang dilakukan China untuk merebut status Superpower dengan memperkuat beberapa sektor. Sektor mana yang paling kuat yang menjadi modal utama China menjadi super power saat ini?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof. B.C: Kalau memperhatikan strategi yang dilancarkan China tampaknya sektor ekonomi, industri dan teknologi tinggi merupakan sektor-sektor yang paling kuat dan paling ditakuti Amerika saat ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Hi.id: Menjadi penantang Amerika Serikat, China tentu memiliki beberapa kekurangan. Jika dibandingkan dengan Amerika Serikat, sektor manakah yang menjadi titik kekurangan China?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof. B.C: Salah satu kekurangan China saat ini adalah ketidakmampuan China meninggalkan praktek-praktek buruk otoritarianisme. Sudah menjadi rahasia umum bahwa kebijakan China di Xinjiang yang sangat represif sangat merugikan dan menginjak-injak nilai-nilai kemanusiaan. Sebagai contoh China saat ini menahan tidak kurang dari 1 juta warga Uyghur muslim di Xinjiang dan melakukan tindakan sewenang-wenang lain yang menghina kaum muslimin yang merupakan penduduk mayoritas propinsi Xinjiang. Sayang bahwa negara-negara Barat saat ini juga tampak tidak peduli dengan tragedi uyghur tersebut karena mengutamakan kerjasama ekonomi dengan Chinan sehingga kurang peduli terhadap kaum muslimin di kawasan tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Hi.id: Respon dunia internasional melihat kebangkitan China tentu mendapat pro dan kontra. Bagaimana China berdiplomasi menghadapi hal ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof. B.C: Kebangkitan China diawali dengan keberhasilan China dalam membangun perekonomian dalam negeri. Keberhasilan ini mulai mempengaruhi hubungan internasional sejakterus menerus meningkatkan kerjasama ekonominya dengan berbagai negara di Timur Tengah, Asia Tengah, Asia Selatan dan Afrika pada saat Amerika sibuk melakukan kampanye perang melawan terorisme di Timur Tengah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kecurigaan Barat khususnya Amerika adalah sejak munculnya istilah <em>the Rise of China</em> oleh pimpinan pemerintah China namun kemudian diubah oleh Hu Jintao menjadi <em>the Peaceful Development</em> untuk menenangkan kecurigaan Barat terhadap kemungkinan kebangkitan China sesungguhnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pada saat Xi Jinping naik ke puncak kepmimpinan China tahun 2013 ia menggulirkan kebijakan <em>the New Silk Road</em> di Kazakhstan, negara Asia Tengah yang sudah cukup lama menjalin hubungan perdagangan dengan China sekaligus jembatan pipa minyak dan gas alam dari Asia Tengah ke daratan China. Kelak <em>the New Silk Road</em> berkembangan menjadi <em>Belt and Road Initiative</em> (BRI) yang merrupakan proyek pembangunan jalan, jembatan, rel kereta api, pelabuhan dan sistem komunikasi dengan China sebagai pemasok dana, tenaga ahli, dan material bangunan. Kebijakan BRI ini mirip <em>Marshall Plan</em> Amerika tahun 1948 di Eropa. Tapi BRI jauh lebih luas cakupanya karena meliputi kawasan Asia Tenggara, Asia Selatan, Asia Tengah, Eropa Timur, Timur Tengah dan Afrika bahkan Eropa. Kebijakan ekonomi ini tidak disertai embel-embel demokrasi dan HAM sebagaimana bantuan luar negeri Amerika dan Eropa di negara-negara berkembang. Karakter ini sangat menarik kebanyakan negara berkembang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Hi.id: Sumber Daya Manusia (SDM) tentu menjadi salah satu hal yang fundamental dalam menopang sebuah Negara. Bagaimana China mempersiapkan SDM-nya untuk menopang ambisi ini?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof. B.C: Sejak 1979 Deng Xiaoping telah mengirimkan ratusan mahasiswa ke Amerika meraih gelar Master dan PhD di Universitas ternama di negeri Paman Sam. Para alumni Amerika inilah yang kini menjadi elit politik, ekonomi, industri, teknologi, pendidikan dan keuangan China saat ini. merekalah penggerak utama dan menempatkan China sebagai the Largest eocomy setahun dua tahun yang lalu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nChina menduduki ranking sangat tinggi dalam jumlah artikel <em>scopus</em> dibandingkan Amerika. China juga memfasilitasi para profesor China maupun non China dengan fasilitas serba mewah tidak kalah dari kampus-kampus di Amerika dan Eropa untuk menghasilkan karya-karya akademik kelas dunia. Profesor di China bergaji tidak kurang dari US$ 300 ribu hingga 400 ribu per tahun dengan fasilitas lengkap. Kerjasama PT China dan PT Barat sudah berlangsung cukup lama. China juga mengundang Profesor top dari berbagai belahan dunia untuk mengejar ketinggalan dari Barat. Kampus-kampus China sudah seperti kampus di Barat fasilitasnya sehingga berani bersaing dengan kampur dunia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Hi.id: China mendapatkan perlawanan dari Amerika Serikat yang mencoba menggunakan strategi perang dagang untuk menghantam China. Apakah ini strategi yang tepat menurut Anda? Bagaimana dampaknya terhadap perekonomian Amerika Serikat dan China?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof. B.C: Perang Dagang merupakan strategi Trump untuk menekan kemajuan ekonomi, sains dan teknologi China yang seakan tak terbendung. Sebetulnya berpotensi merugikan keduanya namun China memiliki cara untuk melawan balik sambil mencari jalan keluar jika situasinya genting khusus pada sektor tertentu yang menuntut tindakan cepat. Perang Dagang merupakan langkah awal Amerika untuk menghentikan sama sekali kemajuan China oleh karena itu Trump menuntut China menghentikan kebijakan Made in China 2025 yang meresahkan Amerika.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Hi.id: Kekuatan China saat ini membawa &ldquo;terror&rdquo; tersendiri bagi kawasan ASEAN khususnya terkait Laut China Selatan. Indonesia pun turut merasakan hal ini. Bagaimana pendapat Anda tentang kehadiran China di kawasan ASEAN?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof. B.C: Kehadiran China memberikan keuntungan bercampur kecemasan. ASEAN perlu memanfaatkan peluang bisnis secara kritis sebagaimana Mahathir lakukan. Tetap tenang dan bekerjasama sambil mengawasi segala kemungkinan buruk yg mungkin terjadi</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Hi.id: Strategi China untuk menjadi Superpower tentu tidak luput dari dominasi di kawasan Asia Tenggara sebagai salah satu kawasan potensial untuk menopang kekuatan China. Bagaimana Indonesia harus bersikap dalam hal ini?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof. B.C: China adalah peluang sekaligus tantangan. Indonesia perlu melihat China dalam perspektif tersebut sehingga mengambil manfaat sebanyak mungkin. Oleh karena itu, sebaiknya Indonesia mengambil sikap moderat dan penuh kewaspadaan. Mahatir sangat bagus dalam menanggapi proyek China di Malaysia. Kita perlu belajar dari negarawan senior Malaysia yang sangat berpengalaman dalam urusan politik luar negeri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Hi.id: Bagaimana Indonesia dapat mengambil keuntungan dari proyek ambisius China ini?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof. B.C: Indonesia dapat memanfaatkan pasar china yang nyaris tak terbatas sejauh kita mampu melakukannya. Sebagai peluang Indonesia dituntut untuk mampu menjadikan pasar China yang sangat besar sebagai pasar komoditi Indonesia. Pasar China nyaris tidak terbatas apaagi lebih dari 500 juta penduduk China akan naik status menjadi kelas menengah. Kebutuhan kelas sudah tentu sangat banyak dan kita perlu pakar ekonomi untuk identifikasi kebutuhan kelas menengah mereka. Mereka juga hobi traveling karena banyak uang di saku. Turisme Indonesia, misalnya, perlu didisain sedemikian rupa agar kelas menengah China suka dengan Indonesia. Jumlah mereka sangat banyak untuk tidak dimanfaatkan oleh Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>HI.id: Bagaimana jika ada pembaca yang tertarik untuk berdiskusi membahas buku yang Anda tulis?

Peribahasa ini tentu sudah sering kita dengar untuk menggambarkan bagaimana keragaman adat dan budaya yang ada di Indonesia. Setiap wilayah memiliki adat istiadatnya tersendiri dengan keragaman dan perbedaan yang luar biasa. Hal ini juga tentunya memiliki pengaruh pada setiap orang yang mendatangi tempat tersebut. Tak jarang seorang pendatang akan mengalami &ldquo;<em>culture shock</em>&rdquo; ketika awal melihat dan mengalami langsung perbedaan yang ada. Tentunya hal ini juga berlaku bagi seorang dosen yang mengajar di tempat yang berbeda dengan tanah kelahirannya. Entah itu di perkotaan/pinggiran, ataupun dekat/jauh dari pemerintah pusat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nArtikel ini ditulis untuk mencoba memberikan gambaran tentang bagaimana mengajar di Papua, yang merupakan wilayah paling timur dari Indonesia. Adapun tujuan dari artikel ini ditulis sepenuhnya untuk kepentingan akademis. Pada kesempatan kali ini, HubunganInternasional.id berkesempatan untuk melakukan wawancara dengan salah satu HI-<em>Sir</em> yang bernama Hendry Bakri, S.IP, M.Si. Beliau merupakan salah satu dosen yang mengajar di Program Studi Hubungan Internasional Fakultas Ilmu Sosial dan Ilmu Politik Universitas Sains dan Teknologi Jayapura (USTJ). Berikut hasil wawancaranya:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HubunganInternasional.id (HI.id): Bisa tolong ceritakan, apa yang membawa anda sampai mengajar di Universitas Sains dan Teknologi Jayapura?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Hendry Bakri (H.B): Sebelum saya menjawab pertanyaan wawancara. Izinkan saya ucapkan terimakasih untuk hubunganinternasional.id, saya merasa tersanjung dihubungi dan diwawancarai. Tak lupa saya ucapkan terimakasih untuk dua orang yang berjasa memperkenalkan saya dengan HI. Yang pertama, Kak Mattewakan (HI Unhas &rsquo;93), beliau memperkenalkan saya dengan senior-senior HI Unhas, memberikan saya buku HI serta mengantar saya ke bandara menuju Papua. Yang kedua, saudara Achmad Zulfikar, memperkenalkan saya dengan AIHII.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Jika saya boleh sedikit bercerita, keberadaan saya di HI USTJ tidak lepas dari campur tangan Tuhan. Di tahun 2016, istri (waktu itu masih calon istri) memasukkan lamaran kerja &ndash;saya dan istri- ke USTJ, dia mendapat info dari rekan Achmad Zulfikar. Istri lebih dulu berangkat ke Papua di bulan Maret 2016, sedangkan saya pada saat itu masih enggan ke Papua, sulit bagi saya meninggalkan Kota Makassar. Makassar adalah zona nyaman, saya menimba ilmu dari S1 dan S2 di Ilmu Politik Unhas. Banyak aktifitas dan sahabat di Makassar. Butuh dua bulan untuk saya bisa menentukan pilihan, tepatnya bulan Mei 2016 saya putuskan untuk ke Papua. Semua karena masukan dari beberapa sahabat dan senior di Makassar. Di USTJ, istri mengabdi di Prodi Ilmu Pemerintahan. USTJ tidak ada Prodi Ilmu Politik, maka saya ditempatkan di Prodi HI. Bapak Aria Aditya Setiawan, S.IP, M.Si (wakil dekan/dosen HI) banyak berjasa bagi saya dan istri sejak kami datang ke USTJ. Beliau banyak membantu kami dari pengurusan NIDN, hingga kepangkatan. Bapak Aria yang juga menentukan mata kuliah bagi saya untuk mengajar, mata kuliah yang sesuai dengan basic keilmuan saya Politik seperti: Pengantar Ilmu Politik, Ide-ide Politik, Komunikasi Politik, Teori Politik Klasik dan Kontemporer, Politik Pemerintahan Afrika. Kaprodi kami juga, Bapak Yakub Tasik, S.IP, MKP juga S1-nya HI Unhas. Sehingga banyak dibantu beliau terhusus pengalaman beliau selama di USTJ</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Sudah berapa lama anda mengajar di USTJ?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(H.B): Saya terhitung datang ke USTJ bulan Mei tahun 2016 menjadi dosen, saya mengajar pada bulan Agustus 2016 tahun ajaran baru. Dari bulan Mei hingga Agustus saya membantu rekan-rekan dosen HI untuk akreditasi Prodi dan melakukan diskusi lepas dengan beberapa mahasiswa Ilmu Pemerintahan. Saya baru bersentuhan langsung dengan mahasiswa HI pada bulan Agustus, dan dipercayakan Kaprodi menjadi Dosen Wali mahasiswa HI angkatan 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Pernahkah anda mengajar di tempat lain sebelum ke Jayapura, Papua?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(H.B): Sebelum ke Papua saya banyak menghabiskan waktu di Unhas. Saya, istri dan saudara Achmad Zulfikar, dipercaya mengelola Jurnal Pascasarjana Politik di Unhas Makassar. Saya menjadi pengajar lepas atau relawan bersama beberapa komunitas di Makassar. Cita-cita saya bukanlah dosen. Saya lebih menikmati menjadi peneliti atau surveyor. Beberapa dosen senior memberikan saya pencerahan terkait Tridarma Perguruan Tinggi: Pengajaran, Penelitian dan Pengabdian Masyarakat. Dengan menjadi dosen saya bisa menjalankan hobi saya sekaligus, meneliti dan pengabdian pada masyarakat. Itulah gairah saya!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Momen pertama menginjakkan kaki di tanah Papua, seperti apa rasanya ketika itu?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(H.B): Dari Makassar saya telah banyak mendapat info Papua dan USTJ. Menyebut kata timur (Papua), tentu dipikiran khalayak umum adalah Freeport, ketidakadilan, biaya hidup tinggi, dan sebagainya. Awal pertama datang saya cukup sulit beradaptasi, sempat mengalami frustasi dan ingin kembali ke Makassar, karena perbedaan kultur akademik yang saya rasakan. Saya merasakan kesunyian hingga saya berada di titik jenuh, berbeda dengan di Makassar yang saya temukan adalah budaya diskusi di kantin, di pelataran, dan aktifitas mahasiswa organisasinya cukup kuat. Pelan-pelan saya menyadari, keberadaan saya di Papua khususnya HI USTJ adalah rencana mahakuasa untuk saya bisa keluar dari zona nyaman, dan memulai hidup baru. Keberadaan saya di Papua adalah bersama-sama dengan rekan dosen yang lain mencerdaskan Papua dan memajukan Papua dengan apa yang kami miliki. Saya lalu bertemu mahasiswa Ilmu Pemerintahan dan mengajak mereka duduk diskusi, hingga kami membentuk komunitas literasi (Sako EXplore). Berjalannya waktu, komunitas ini berkembang dan memfokuskan pada literasi di Papua. Saya meminta kesediaan, mengajak beberapa rekan di luar Papua untuk bergabung tujuannya sama-sama membangun dan menoleh ke timur. Rekan-rekan di luar Papua membantu setiap bulan mengirim buku ke kami. Sehingga kami membangun jaringan literasi one book for Papua.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Interaksi pertama di dalam kelas dengan HI-bro dan HI-sis di Universitas anda, bisa ceritakan kembali momen-momen itu?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(H.B): Interaksi pertama kali, bagi saya seru. Butuh perjuangan, rekan-rekan dosen di Kota-Kota besar tentu lebih mudah mengajar, mahasiswanya adalah lulusan SMA yang bisa saya katakan produk jadi, sedangkan kami, mahasiswa datang dari segala keterbatasan selama SMA, baik minimnya fasilitas hingga tingkat ekonomi keluarga. Tapi di situlah serunya. Bila di Kota besar lebih banyak mengajar menggunakan kata-kata rumit, kami di sini puya tantangan menyederhanakan yang rumit sehingga mudah dipahami mahasiswa. Sebagai seorang dosen saya pun wajib menghargai budaya Papua &ndash;kesukuan- sesekali saya menggunakan kalimat Papua, agar mereka mudah mengerti.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Memang mereka datang kuliah dengan segala keterbatasan. Ada hal yang perlu dicatat, beberapa dari mereka punya prestasi membanggakan, hanya jarang terekspose ke media. Prestasi anak Papua jarang dipublish media, yang paling sering dipublish adalah anarkisme mahasiswa timur, padahal di belahan timur punya bakat dan prestasi. Mereka hanya bercerita kepada beberapa dosen saja, sehingga harapan saya dosen dan mahasiswa perlu membangun interaksi sosial tanpa ada sekat, tapi tetap dalam batasan saling menghargai dan menghormati. Mahasiswa Papua punya potensi, tetapi kebanyakan memiliki sifat pemalu dan takut salah, dikarenakan mereka hidup dengan stigma-stigma orang di luar sana bahwa mereka terbelakang. Untuk maju satu langkah mereka cenderung minder. Mereka butuh motivasi ekstra dan pendampingan, bangkitkan semangat juang mereka. Yakinkan bahwa mereka juga bisa, anak-anak di timur jangan dianaktirikan, tapi diberi perhatian, kembangkan apa yang mereka miliki.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Fasilitas penunjang pendidikan masih sedikit menjadi kendala, terutama bacaan terbaru. Memang ada toko buku, tetapi ada beberapa mahasiswa yang tingkat ekonominya ke bawah, lalu masih bisa dikatakan sulit mendapatkan bacaan terbaru. Saya pikir, mereka di kelas cukup hebat, hanya perlu ditingkatkan lagi budaya membaca, diskusi, menulis dan berorganisasi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Pengalaman anda, mengajar di Papua dan berinteraksi langsung dengan masyarakat di sana, tentu menjadi pengalaman yang berbeda bagi sebagian besar dosen khususnya yang menumpuk di Pulau Jawa. Bisa tolong anda jelaskan bagaimana keseruan-keseruan yang terjadi ketika anda mengajar mereka?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Hendry Bakri (H.B): Bagi saya mengajar mereka itu seru! Penuh dengan tantangan, apalagi ketika saya di kantin, mereka datang beramai-ramai menanyakan buku/hendak meminjam buku atau menanyakan saran terkait kegiatan organisasi mahasiswa. Kami diskusi di kantin. Saya memang sedang membangun budaya bahwa tidak selamanya belajar itu di kelas, tetapi belajar bisa di mana saja, semua murid semua guru. Bangun jaringan pertemanan dan saling bertukar ide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/FK6NCAVgWROzARl4.jpg\" style=\"height:323px; width:352px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: Dokumentasi pribadi Hendry Bakri</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Bagi sekelompok oknum HI-bro dan HI-sis tertentu, mungkin memiliki pandangan yang berseberangan dengan pemerintah merupakan hal yang lazim.

Berkaitan dengan hal tersebut pula, sempat terdengar kabar beberapa waktu lalu terjadi aksi solidaritas oleh para oknum HI-bro dan HI-sis di sana. Sebagai seorang dosen, bagaimana anda berhadapan dengan kondisi seperti ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(H.B): Saya suka demonstrasi. Waktu saya mahasiswa saya senang turun ke jalan menyuarakan aspirasi. Kalau demonstrasi kita sudah hampir tidak mengenal namanya prodi, yang kita bawa adalah mahasiswa. Terkait mahasiswa Papua dan isu Papua, saya tidak bisa menjelaskan banyak hal, masalah Papua begitu kompleks, memang banyak bacaan bertaburan terkait isu Papua, hanya saya pikir jika ingin tau tentang Papua, ke Papualah dan rasakan apa yang mereka rasakan. Mahasiswa di Papua demo bagi saya mereka menjalankan fungsi mahasiswa agent of change dan social control, dan bagi saya itulah student movement. Saya hanya bisa menyarankan perkuat dirimu dengan belajar dan membaca banyak referensi. Demo tidak salah, tetapi wajib dengan cara elegan dan cerdas. Saya baru mau jalan tiga tahun di Papua, focus saya adalah membangun budaya literasi Papua sejak dini, karena bagi saya pendidikan adalah senjata paling ampuh menciptakan peradaban intelektual. Anak Papua lah yang paling tau soal Papua, sehingga yang paling cocok untuk menjawab pertanyaan adalah anak Papua</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Apa contoh kegiatan di luar perkuliahan yang pernah anda lakukan bersama mahasiswa/mahasiswi anda untuk mengembangkan minat dan bakat mereka?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(H.B): Kegiatan (ada) banyak. Saya sering ikutkan mereka event di luar Papua bila ada. Bila ada rejeki kami ke Makassar, bersama istri patungan untuk membawa beberapa mahasiswa Papua ke luar. Bila ada penelitian dari instansi pemerintahan/lembaga survey kami libatkan mahasiswa, agar mereka juga belajar.

Apa gelar Sarjanamu?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nGelar kesarjanaan akan dilekatkan oleh Universitas ketika seorang mahasiswa/i berhasil menyelesaikan jenjang studi yang ditempuh. Hal ini merupakan salah satu momen yang mungkin akan selalu dikenang khususnya ketika mengingat kembali dunia perkuliahan. Setiap jurusan perkuliahan memiliki gelar khas masing-masing yang menunjukkan identitas keilmuan yang diambil pada jenjang sarjana. Khusus bagi kalian semua HI-<em>bro</em> dan HI-<em>sis</em> yang dalam waktu dekat ini akan lulus, kali ini HubunganInternasional.id akan bertanya kepada kalian semua, apa (yang akan menjadi) gelar sarjana kalian?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebelum masuk dalam pembahasan gelar, hubunganinternasional.id ingin mengajak para pembaca untuk melihat Keputusan Menteri Riset, Teknologi, dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia Nomor 257/M/KPT/2017 tentang Nama Program Studi pada Perguruan Tinggi (cek di sini). Pada poin 6 (enam) Rumpun Ilmu Sosial dengan jelas menunjukkan bahwasanya gelar sarjana untuk mahasiswa/i Hubungan Internasional adalah Sos (untuk lihat berkasnya silakan <a href=\"http://belmawa.ristekdikti.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Lampiran-I.pdf\">klik di sini</a>). Lalu mengapa pertanyaan tentang &ldquo;apa gelar sarjanamu&rdquo; diajukan dalam artikel ini? Karena saat ini ada 4 (empat) gelar yang digunakan sebagai gelar sarjana untuk mahasiswa Hubungan Internasional. Mengapa bisa demikian? Menurut Sekjen AIHII Asep Kamaluddin, hal ini dikarenakan adanya perbedaan pandangan secara filosofis di kalangan akademisi HI terkait masalah gelar yang akan dipakai sebagai identitas kesarjanaan mahasiswa Hubungan Internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pada pertemuan rutin tahunan yang diselenggarakan oleh AIHII bekerjasama dengan Universitas Mulawarman pada tahun 2017 di Banjarmasin masalah gelar Sarjana mahasiswa/i Hubungan Internasional telah dibahas di komisi akademik. Hasil dari pembahasan sidang tersebut adalah komisi akademik AIHII pada poin 8 (delapan) sepakat untuk mendorong pengurus AIHII untuk meminta Dikti mengizinkan penggunaan gelar yang telah digunakan masing-masing Universitas. Adapun gelar yang dimaksud antara lain:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Sarjana Ilmu Politik yang disingkat S.IP.<br />\r\n2. Sarjana Sosial yang disingkat S.Sos.<br />\r\n3. Sarjana Hubungan Internasional yang disingkat S.Hub.Int.<br />\r\n4. Sarjana Hubungan Internasional yang disingkat S.H.Int.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kondisi ini tentunya mendapatkan perhatian tersendiri dari pengurus AIHII. Untuk itu, permasalahan gelar pun akhirnya masuk sebagai salah satu acuan bagi Program Kerja Pengurus AIHII Periode 2017-2020 yang terkait dengan hal akademik. Ketua AIHII Yusran menjelaskan kepada hubunganinternasional.id bahwasanya masalah gelar akan kembali dibahas pada Konvensi Nasional AIHII di Universitas Mataram Raja Ali Haji (UMRAH) Tanjung Pinang.<em> &ldquo;Hendaknya masalah gelar ini dapat diselesaikan dalam vennas (Konvensi Nasional) yang akan datang agar tidak menjadi beban tahunan.

Hal ini tidak terlepas dari kepentingan AIHII untuk memiliki satu gelar yang akan diakui dan dijadikan rujukan secara nasional oleh Universitas lainnya. AIHII sebagai asosiasi profesi yang menaungi Prodi Hubungan Internasional se-Indonesia akan menyampaikan ke Kemenristek DIKTI terkait keputusan mengenai gelar ini</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/ErecfyoViNBlU4mv.png\" style=\"height:350px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image: </em>http://www.aihii.or.id/logo-aihii/</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apakah hasil keputusan terkait gelar Sarjana mahasiswa/i Hubungan Internasional akan tetap menggunakan gelar S.Sos yang sesuai dengan Keputusan Menristek DIKTI saat ini? Ataukah gelar tersebut akan diganti dengan salah satu dari tiga gelar lainnya? Jika berdasarkan keputusan sidang organisasi gelar akan diganti, lalu gelar apa yang akan disepakati oleh AIHII yang kemudian disodorkan kepada kementrian terkait untuk menggantikan gelar sebelumnya?

Berdasarkan wawancara tim hubunganinternaisonal.id, ketua AIHII Yusran memastikan bahwa gelar ini tidak hanya sampai pada kesepakatan bersama. Tetapi juga akan diusulkan ke pihak Kemenristek DIKTI untuk kemudian mengganti gelar yang saat ini diakui oleh pihak kementerian yaitu S.Sos. Akan tetapi proses ini menemui sedikit kendala pada proses audiensi yang sampai saat ini belum dapat dilakukan. &ldquo;<em>Status kita saat ini harus wait kabar selanjutnya (untuk audiensi), waktu itu sempat secara mendadak dia (pihak Kemenristek) bisa tapi saya lagi di Riau, jadi tidak bisa.

(11,24,1,'Migrasi dan Transnasionalisme di Pasifik Selatan','',NULL,'<p>Migrasi merupakan salah satu fenomena dalam Hubungan Internasional yang lagi marak terjadi. Hal ini tidak terlepas dari faktor pendorong dari negara asal seperti misalnya kondisi kesejahteraan yang kurang, bencana alam atau bahkan perang, serta faktor penarik dari negara tujuan seperti kehidupan yang lebih baik, pekerjaan, kebebasan dan lain-lain. Permasalahan migrasi ini ternyata tidak selalu menyelesaikan masalah. Justru masalah-masalah baru muncul dari fenomena ini seperti negara asal yang ditinggalkan, negara tujuan yang dituju sampai pada pelaku migrasi itu sendiri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pembahasan mengenai isu migrasi ini ternyata mendapatkan perhatian khusus di mata salah seorang dosen dari Prodi Hubungan Internasional, Fakultas Ilmu Sosial dan Ilmu Politik, Universitas Airlangga. Isu tersebut dibahas dalam sebuah buku dengan judul &ldquo;<em>Migrasi dan Transnasionalisme di Pasifik Selatan</em>&rdquo; yang ditulis oleh Dra. Baiq Wardhani, M.A., Ph.D. Pada karyanya kali ini, Baiq Wardhani menggandeng M. Doni Faisal dan Theodora D. Paramita yang mana keduanya merupakan alumni HI FISIP UNAIR. Hubunganinternasional.id pun mencoba menghubungi HI-<em>ma&rsquo;am</em> yang bernama Baiq Wardhani untuk bertanya terkait beberapa hal. Mari simak wawancaranya di bawah ini:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Hubunganinternasional.id (HI.id): Apa yang melatarbelakangi anda dan tim menulis buku yang berjudul &ldquo;Migrasi dan Transnasionalisme di Pasifik Selatan?&rdquo;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baiq Wardhani (B.W): Buku ini hadir karena beberapa sebab:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(1) Sedikitnya bahan bacaan yang tersedia tentang Pasifik Selatan karena tidak banyak orang Indonesia yang tertarik dengan wilayah ini;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2) Untuk memenuhi tuntutan para mahasiswa, khususnya di HI FISIP Unair, yang mengambil mata kuliah Masyarakat, Kebudayaan, dan Politik Australia, Timor Leste, dan Pasifik Barat Daya;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3) Untuk kepentingan umum, khususnya pengembil kebijakan, politisi, jurnalis, maupun mereka yang awam dengan Pasifik Selatan;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(4) Untuk mengabadikan karya ilmiah dan/atau tugas akhir mahasiswa dan/alumni yang menulis topik tentang Pasifik Selatan.

Ini merupakan ironi karena kedekatan geografis adalah kenyataan yang tidak bisa dipungkiri. Kedekatan geografis membawa implikasi dalam banyak bidang, baik itu politik, sosial, ekonomi, kultural, dan sebagainya. Mengabaikan kawasan terdekat dapat berdampak negatif bagi Indonesia;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2) Beberapa universitas di Indonesia mulai banyak yang menawarkan mata kuliah yang berkaitan dengan Australia dan Pasifik Selatan, tetapi terbatasnya bahan bacaan menjadi salah satu penyebab tidak terlalu diminatinya mata kuliah tersebut. Di HI FISIP Unair mata kuliah ini ditawarkan sejak saya masih menjadi mahasiswa pada awal 1980-an dan masih terdapat di kurikulum kami, tetapi peminatnya tidak pernah banyak (tidak pernah lebih dari 20 orang). Di satu pihak ini memberi kelebihan tersendiri karena pembelajaran yang efisien dan efektif, namun di sisi lain menunjukkan ketidaktahuan, mungkin juga ketidakpedualian pada salah satu kawasan terdekat Indonesia;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3) Pasifik Selatan semakin banyak menjadi perhatian internasional karena banyaknya masalah global yang dihadapi, seperti perubahan iklim dan masalah lingkungan, migrasi, kejahatan transnasional, <em>poor governance</em>, ketergantungan pada bantuan luar negeri; resiko bencana alam, gerakan pemisahan diri, dan masih banyak masalah lainnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Berapa lama proses pengerjaan buku ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(B.W): Efektifnya sekitar 6 bulan, walaupun bahan penulisan sudah ada sekitar 1 tahun yang lalu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Buku yang ditulis oleh beberapa penulis biasanya memiliki tantangan tersendiri dalam hal penyatuan ide dan gagasan. Adakah hal menarik yang bisa diceritakan dalam proses pengerjaannya?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(B.W): Tidak terlalu repot dengan urusan penyatuan ide dan gagasan. Saya yang mengikuti irama mereka karena naskah mereka sudah ada terlebih dahulu.&nbsp; Yang terberat bagi saya adalah, saya bertugas mencari benang merah dari dua tulisan tersebut agar tulisan itu lebih <em>make sense</em>, terutama bagi pembaca yang masih awam dengan persoalan di Pasifik. Untuk memahami secara lebih komprehensif, saya banyak juga membaca tentang kebijakan <em>Migration with Dignity</em> Kiribati dan kebijakan <em>Skill Select</em> Australia. Yang juga agak repot adalah urusan teknis, seperti editing <em>footnote</em>, referensi, dan hal-hal semacam itu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>(HI.id): Tolong jelaskan perbedaan mendasar migrasi yang terjadi di Pasifik Selatan dengan migrasi yang terjadi di tempat lain, misalnya di Timur Tengah</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(B.W): Pada dasarnya setiap wilayah punya keunikan tersendiri dibandingkan dengan wilayah-wilayah lain. Migrasi di Pasifik Selatan yang terjadi dalam tiga sampai empat dekade ini didorong oleh faktor perubahan iklim yang berpotensi besar menenggelamkan negara-negara yang berstatus <em>low lying islands</em>.&nbsp; Sebetulnya masalah perpindahan manusia di Pasifik Selatan bukan hal baru karena perpindahan itu telah menjadi kebiasaan mereka sejak beratus-ratus tahun yang lalu. Yang unik di Pasifik Selatan adalah faktor alam yang menjadi pendorong mereka untuk bermigrasi akhir-akhir ini. Selain faktor alam juga terdapat faktor <em>push and pull</em> yang berkaitan dengan tenaga kerja yang khas Pasifik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/Lwq9F3ZTDu0Qs_FS.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: http://catalog.aup.unair.ac.id/home/306-migrasi-dan-transnasionalisme-di-pasifik-selatan-9786024730239.html</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Mengapa anda memilih menggunakan konsep migration with dignity dalam menganalisis fenomena ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(B.W): <em>Migration with Dignity</em> adalah kebijakan migrasi resmi Negara Kiribati yang dinyatakan oleh Presiden Anote Tong (masa jabatan berakhir, sekarang sudah diganti oleh Presiden Taneti Mamau).&nbsp; Kami tidak memilih sendiri konsep tersebut. <em>Migration with Dignity</em> adalah kebijakan migrasi yang unik dan cerdas, namun sayangnya belum ada aturan hukum internasional yang mengaturnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Apa pesan yang ingin anda sampaikan kepada para pembaca melalui tulisan ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(B.W): Kenalilah Pasifik Selatan, salah satu kawasan terdekat Indonesia yang memiliki banyak persoalan, tetapi kita tidak mengetahuinya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>(HI.id): Apakah anda berkenan jika ada pembaca yang ingin menghubungi anda untuk diskusi ataupun sharing terkait tema ini melalui email?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(B.W): Silakan menghubungi email: baiq.wardhani@fisip.unair.ac.id</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Terimakasih atas kebersediaan anda menjawab pertanyaan dari hubunganinternasional.id</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pada sesi berikut ini, hubunganinternasional.id mencoba memberikan kesempatan kepada salah satu HI-<em>bro</em> untuk belajar menuliskan&nbsp;resensi &ldquo;<em>Migrasi dan Transnasionalisme di Pasifik Selatan</em>&rdquo; Alasannya tentu karena salah satu calon pembaca potensial dari buku ini tentunya adalah mahasiswa S1 Hubungan Internasional.

Doni Faisal, dan Theodora D. Paramita. Tujuan dari resensi ini adalah untuk mengekplorasi mengenai permasalahan-permasalahan migrasi dan transnasionalisme di daerah Pasifik Selatan yang meliputi negara-negara Australia, Selandia Baru, Mikronesia, Polinesia, dan Melanesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dalam buku ini, saya menemukan bahwa Baiq Wardhani, M. Doni Faisal, dan Theodora D. Paramita (2018) menyampaikan pokok permasalahan dalam lingkup migrasi dan transnasionalisme yaitu &ldquo;<em>migration with dignity</em>&rdquo; dimana konsep ini didefinisikan sebagai migrasi yang memiliki martabat akibat adanya tekanan-tekanan yang bersifat alamiah dan tentunya dibarengi penguasaan skill yang mumpuni sehingga bukan hanya sekedar migrasi akibat tekanan ekonomi hingga bencana peperangan. Penulis juga mendefinisikan permasalahan tersebut ke dalam konsep transnasionalisme dikarenakan migrasi yang dilakukan oleh bangsa-bangsa di Pasifik Selatan khususnya negara-negara yang termasuk Polinesia, Mikronesia, dan Melanesia sudah melewati yurisdiksi di negara-negara asal mereka sehingga permasalahan tersebut bukan hanya ketidakseimbangan penduduk antar daerah namun juga menyangkut ketidakseimbangan penduduk antar negara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/s-VPQKmYUKWlW-1-.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: William Lie. Mahasiswa Semester 5 Hubungan Internasional FISIP UNS. Dokumentasi Pribadi</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Negara- negara di Pasifik Selatan yang terhimpun dalam <em>Alliance of Small Island States</em> (AOSIS) merupakan negara dengan resiko ancaman yang cukup tinggi akibat pemanasan global yaitu kenaikan air laut. Hal ini berdampak kepada prinsip ketahanan suatu negara. Dalam studi kasus yang dijelaskan, Kiribati melakukan strategi adaptasi dengan tujuan untuk mengurangi kerentanan dan meningkatkan ketahanan dalam menghadapi dampak buruk dari perubahan iklim yaitu salah satunya dengan cara migration with dignity. <em>Migration with dignity</em> akan dapat memastikan bahwa I-Kiribati (warga negara Kiribati) akan <em>survive</em> di negara tujuan apabila mereka memiliki keterampilan yang memadai sehingga mereka mampu hidup dengan <em>dignity</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selain Kiribati, Fiji juga melakukan strategi adaptasi atas tuntutan Australia yang melakukan<em> skill-select </em>dalam menyeleksi imigran-imigran yang datang ke negaranyanya. Strategi yang dilakukan oleh Fiji ialah <em>bilateral and multilateral base policy</em> dimana Fiji memaksimalkan peran forum-forum kerjasama untuk meningkatkan partisipasi warganya dalam menghadapi <em>skill-select</em> seperti melibatkan diri pada pasukan perdamaian PBB hingga memaksimalkan kuota SCV (<em>Special Visa Category</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pada akhirnya kita dapat melihat gambaran bagaimana isu lingkungan seperti kenaikan air laut dapat menjadi ancaman bagi sebuah negara. Kerentanan sebagai hasil dari fenomena kenaikan air laut dapat memberikan tantangan bagi pemerintah negara-negara di Pasifik Selatan dalam memberikan perlindungan terhadap keamanan masyarakat dan keamanan nasionalnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebagai penutup, tulisan Baiq Wardhani, M. Doni Faisal, dan Theodora D. Paramita membuka jendela pengetahuan baru mengenai wilayah Pasifik Selatan dan ancamannya yang jarang diperhatikan oleh pembelajar Ilmu Hubungan Internasional di Indonesia. Buku ini cocok dibaca oleh berbagai kalangan dikarenakan bahasanya yang mudah dipahami meskipun ada beberapa keluputan redaksional menyangkut konjungsi namun hal tersebut bukanlah masalah besar. Isu-isu yang dipaparkan dalam buku ini berhasil menjadikan landasan berpikir bagi para pembaca untuk mengetahui dan menganalisis permasalahan yang terjadi di wilayah regional Pasifik. Saya merekomendasikan buku ini sebagai bahan bacaan untuk para pegiat studi Ilmu Hubungan Internasional khususnya mahasiswa/mahasiswi yang berfokus kepada kajian kawasan regional karena buku ini, menurut saya, dapat menjadi salah satu panduan dasar dalam menganalisis fenomena-fenomena migrasi dan transnasionalisme di wilayah Pasifik Selatan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">Surakarta, 16 Oktober 2018<br />\r\nPemberi Resensi,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">William Lie<br />\r\n(Mahasiswa Semester 5 Hubungan Internasional FISIP Universitas Sebelas Maret Surakarta)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adapun informasi lain yang bisa didapat oleh hubunganinternasional.id mengenai buku Migrasi dan Transnasionalisme di Pasifik Selatan yaitu buku ini merupakan cetakan pertama &ndash; 2018 dan merupakan buku yang diterbitkan oleh Airlangga University Press, Surabaya.

(13,24,1,'Jadi, Kamu Pilih Jurusan HI?','',NULL,'<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Proses transisi dari siswa menjadi mahasiswa merupakah salah satu momen penting di kalangan akademisi. Banyak sekali hal berbeda yang akan dihadapi khususnya di awal masa perkuliahan. Tidak jarang hal ini menyebabkan shock di kalangan beberapa mahasiswa baru (maba), mulai dari kultur belajar, bobot materi di dalam perkuliahan, interaksi sosial antar mahasiswa/mahasiswi, kegiatan organisasi dan lainnya. Untuk meminimalisir <em>shock</em> tersebut biasanya di kampus diadakan berbagai kegiatan dalam menyambut maba yang biasa disebut masa orientasi (atau apalah namanya). Hal ini diharapkan dapat mengenalkan maba kepada lingkungan barunya sehingga dapat mempermudah proses adaptasi dari maba dengan agenda-agenda yang ada di kampus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Jika masa orientasi tersebut diadakan oleh kampus untuk mengenalkan maba terhadap dunia perkuliahan, begitu pula dengan buku yang ditulis oleh Agung Setiyo Wibowo. M.Si. Buku dengan judul <em>&ldquo;Jadi, Kamu Pilih Jurusan HI?&rdquo;</em> ini layaknya buku panduan bagi para calon maba yang berminat untuk bergabung dalam jurusan Hubungan Internasional. Buku ini ditulis oleh salah seorang HI-<em>sir</em> yang merupakan salah satu dosen yang aktif mengajar di Universitas Satya Negara Indonesia Jakarta. Hubunganinternasional.id mencoba mewawancarai penulis terkait buku karangannya tersebut. Mari simak wawancaranya!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>Hubunganinternasional.id (hi.id): Bisa anda jelaskan apa motivasi anda menulis buku ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Agung Setiyo Wibowo (ASW): Buku ini merupakan salah satu bukti kegelisahan saya dengan kualitas lulusan hubungan internasional. Faktornya tidak lain ialah nihilnya buku panduan (populer) yang mengenalkan calon mahasiswa tentang jurusan hubungan internasional. Sehingga, banyak yang mengambil jurusan ini karena ikut-ikutan teman, dipaksa orang tua, atau sekedar coba-coba. Akibatnya, kualitas mereka ketika tamat belum dapat mencapai titik optimal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Mengapa saya gelisah? Karena saya menemukan banyak teman seangkatan kuliah maupun mahasiswa HI pada umumnya yang memprihatinkan proses belajarnya. Hal ini dipicu oleh minimnya pengetahuan mereka mengenai potensi diri sendiri (seperti minat, bakat, passion) dan &ldquo;kebutaan&rdquo; mereka tentang jurusan hubungan internasional. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(hi.id): Beberapa hal yang ditulis dalam buku anda menggambarkan dunia perkuliahan khususnya di jurusan Hubungan Internasional dengan sangat baik. Apakah ini berasal dari sebuah pengalaman pribadi anda ketika duduk di bangku kuliah?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(ASW):&nbsp; Semua buku saya berbasis riset, termasuk buku <em>&ldquo;Jadi, Kamu Pilih Jurusan HI? Cerita Seorang Alumnus Hubungan Internasional dan Teman-temannya.&rdquo;</em> Tentu ada cerita pribadi yang mewarnai. Namun, hasil riset lebih menonjol. Karena data yang saya ambil melibatkan alumni HI lintas generasi, almamater dan profesi dari seluruh wilayah di tanah air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em><strong>(hi.id): Menurut pendapat anda, apa tantangan terbesar yang dihadapi oleh maba ketika awal bergabung dalam jurusan Hubungan Internasional?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(ASW):&nbsp; Kebutaan mengenai jurusan hubungan internasional menyebabkan mereka kaget. Karena persepsi mereka mengambil program studi ini tidak jarang yang berbeda dengan kenyataan di lapangan. Banyak yang menikmati proses perkuliahan hingga tamat. Namun, tidak sedikit yang berhenti di tengah jalan karena merasa &ldquo;salah jurusan&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/xKlJvC_mQcDQ4BJu.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>: Agung Setiyo Wibowo, Penulis Buku &quot;Jadi, Kamu Pilih Jurusan HI?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(hi.id): Writing and Speaking! Seberapa penting skill ini bagi mahasiswa Hubungan Internasional?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(ASW):&nbsp; Di era Masyarakat Ekonomi ASEAN ini, dunia telah berubah dengan sedemikian cepatnya. Oleh karena itu, memiliki sifat agile tidak bisa ditawar lagi untuk memenangkan era disrupsi yang dikenal dengan VUCA (<em>Volatility</em>, <em>Uncertainty</em>, <em>Complexity</em> &amp; <em>Ambiguity</em>) ini. Tentu alumni hubungan internasional bisa beraktualisasi di bidang apa saja ketika unggul dalam <em>Writing</em> dan <em>Speaking</em>. Entah menjadi diplomat, aktivis NGO, staf organisasi internasional, jurnalis, penyiar, dosen, peneliti, <em>trainer</em>, penulis, pemasar, atau yang lainnya. Itu mengapa saya (masih) ingat dan sepakat dengan pendapat Charles Darwin bahwa bukan yang terkuat yang mampu bertahan, melainkan yang paling mampu menyesuaikan diri dalam menanggapi perubahan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(hi.id): Organisasi kemahasiswaan menyita waktu dan energi yang cukup banyak pada masa perkuliahan. Tidak jarang anggotanya dihadapkan pada pilihan antara memprioritaskan organisasi atau perkuliahan. Meski demikian tidak dapat dipungkiri bahwa organisasi kemahasiswaan juga mampu memberikan hal-hal positif kepada mahasiswa/mahasiswi. Menurut pendapat anda, apa pentingnya bergabung dalam organisasi kemahasiswaan?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(ASW): Keaktifan berorganisasi mampu menempa <em>Soft Skill</em> mahasiswa. Kelak itu bisa menjadi modal dalam memenangkan pasar kerja &ndash; khususnya jika mau bertarung di level regional dan global. Siapapun yang ingin menjadi pemimpin dalam sektor bisnis, pemerintahan, swasta, maupun sosial wajib mengembangkan diri melalui &ldquo;kendaraan&rdquo; organisasi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(hi.id): Go internasional menjadi salah satu cita-cita bagi mahasiswa/mahasiswi Hubungan Internasional. Terlebih jika hal ini berkaitan dengan kegiatan-kegiatan akademik yang dapat menunjang perkuliahan.

Untuk ranah akademik bisa memanfaatkan konferensi internasional, forum regional maupun Model United Nations (MUN). Untuk yang <em>non</em>-akademik bisa mempertimbangkan pertukaran pemuda (mahasiswa) hingga international camp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(hi.id): Pengabdian pada masyarakat menjadi salah satu elemen penting dalam Tridarma Perguruan Tinggi.

Bergantung apa keterampilan, minat, dan <em>passion</em>. Namun yang lebih penting lagi ialah mampu menjawab persoalan yang terjadi di akar rumput. Karena sebaik-baik manusia ialah yang paling bermanfaat bagi orang lain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(hi.id): Selain berbicara masa-masa kuliah, di buku ini anda juga menjelaskan terkait tahapan awal karir. Menurut pendapat anda apa yang menjadi tantangan terbesar di awal menghadapi dunia kerja?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(ASW): Kurikulum HI di berbagai kampus banyak yang tidak terkait dan selaras (<em>link</em> &amp; <em>match</em>) dengan pasar kerja. Ini diperburuk dengan minimnya <em>assessment</em> potensi diri maupun pelatihan seputar karir dari pihak perguruan tinggi. Jadi, banyak lulusan HI yang tidak siap dengan dunia kerja. Singkat kata, kualitas lulusan HI sangat beragam dari individu yang satu dengan yang lainnya.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/0NacfC70u1gx3NwS.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>: Agung Setiyo Wibowo, Penulis Buku &quot;Jadi, Kamu Pilih Jurusan HI?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(hi.id): Tantangan dalam dunia kerja yang akan dihadapi oleh HI-bro dan HI-sis sekarang tentu berbeda dengan zaman anda kuliah dulu.

Berikan alasannya!</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(ASW): Menurut pendapat saya ialah <em>agility</em> (kelincahan). Pasalnya, orang yang lincah biasanya cenderung lebih peka dengan keadaan. Jadi, mereka lebih terdorong untuk memaksimalkan kemampuan berpikir analitis maupun kreatif, menyelesaikan masalah, dan di saat yang bersamaan terasah kecerdasan sosialnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nEra disrupsi dewasa ini sarat dengan volatilitas, ketidakpastian, kompleksitas dan ambiguitas (VUCA).

Lantaran di sanalah &ldquo;kualitas&rdquo; diri sesungguhnya diuji.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Semakin banyak masalah yang mahasiswa/i pecahkan, semakin besar manfaat yang mereka tebarkan untuk sesama.

Magang bisa membuka cakrawala mahasiswa/i akan sengitnya persaingan kerja. Jadi, mereka bisa mengukur diri mengenai kesiapan dan kemampuan diri sendiri di lapangan. Sementara itu, KKN bisa membantu mereka keluar dari &ldquo;menara gading kampus&rdquo; yang terkadang justru membatasi imaginasi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(hi.id): Berkarir sebagai diplomat di Kementerian Luar Negeri Indonesia menjadi angan-angan dari banyak mahasiswa/mahasiswi Hubungan Internasional.

Sebagaimana yang saya tulis dalam buku, banyak kok lulusan HI yang justru &ldquo;bersinar&rdquo; di luar profesi diplomat. Mulai dari penulis, penyiar, penyanyi, pebisnis, pembicara publik, aktivis sosial, bankir, jurnalis dan lainnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(hi.id): Jika ada satu negara yang dapat saya rekomendasikan kepada HI-bro dan HI-sis untuk melanjutkan studinya, maka saya akan merekomendasikan mereka untuk melanjutkan kuliahnya di Negara &hellip;.

Karena bukankah hidup ialah kumpulan dari keputusan atau pilihan kita sendiri? Jika saya yang ditanya, maka saya sangat merekomendasikan HI-<em>bro</em> dan HI-<em>sis</em> untuk belajar di Amerika Serikat. Meskipun belakangan Tiongkok makin menunjukkan tajinya, Amerika Serikat saya rasa masih menjadi pusat peradaban dunia &ndash; setidaknya hingga satu hingga tiga dekade mendatang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(hi.id): Jika saya diberikan kesempatan untuk memilih, suatu saat nanti saya ingin mengajar di Universitas &hellip; Alasannya?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(ASW): Saya lahir dan besar di Magetan, Jawa Timur.

Tujuan dari resensi ini adalah untuk mengetahui dunia perkuliahan dan kehidupan dari mahasiswa Hubungan Internasional (HI) berdasarkan pengalaman dari para alumni mahasiswa HI di Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Saya menemukan bahwa, di dalam buku ini Agung Setiyo Wibowo ingin menjelaskan tentang seluk beluk dunia perkuliahan mahasiswa HI, mulai dari ketika awal memasuki dunia perkuliahan, hal-hal yang perlu diketahui dan dimiliki oleh mahasiswa HI, bahkan ke hal-hal yang kelihatannya cukup simple tapi sebenarnya penting seperti apa yang memotivasi seseorang untuk memilih jurusan HI ketika memasuki dunia perkuliahan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Jurusan HI merupakan salah satu dari 12 program studi terfavorit di Indonesia. Bukan hanya itu, jurusan ini memiliki passing grade yang tinggi sehingga setiap tahunnya banyak yang gagal menjadi mahasiswa HI. Kepopuleran jurusan HI juga dapat dilihat dari banyaknya perguruan tinggi negeri dan swasta dari Sumatra sampai Papua yang memiliki program studi ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/hQ6JL-0yMkWVoC8M.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>: Samuel Teofano Bago.

Buku ini sangat cocok untuk dibaca oleh semua kalangan, khususnya yang ingin menjadi mahasiswa HI, selain karena bahasanya yang mudah dipahami, juga banyak saran yang diberikan mulai dari saran bagaimana menjalan perkuliahan, bahkan saran tempat magang meskipun ada beberapa kesalahan dalam penulisan tetapi itu bukan masalah besar.

Adanya hak-hak &ldquo;istimewa&rdquo; yang memberikan kesempatan setara kepada setiap warga negaranya baik di mata Negara secara politik, hukum, ekonomi dan sosial menjadi nilai tawar yang kuat jika harus dibandingkan dengan sistem politik lainnya. Dalam hal kehidupan berpolitik misalnya, demokrasi dianggap mampu menjaga berjalannya politik yang bersih dan bermartabat. Hal ini tentunya dimungkinkan karena dalam demokrasi kita mengenal yang namanya <em>trias politica</em> yang membatasi kekuasaan agar tidak bertumpuk pada satu orang/kelompok pemegang kekuasaan. Dengan adanya pembagian kekausaan hal ini memungkinkan terjadinya <em>check and balance</em> antar lembaga-lembaga Negara. Tentunya harapan dari semua itu adalah terciptanya politik yang lebih bermoral demi kebaikan bangsa dan masyarakat yang ada di dalamnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pada kesempatan kali ini, Alifia Yumna Amri Mahasiswi Hubungan Internasional Fakultas Ilmu Sosial dan Ilmu Politik Universitas Kristen Satya Wacana akan membahas sebuah buku karangan Dr. Ahmad Sahide, S.IP., M.A yang berjudul &ldquo;Demokrasi dan Moral Politik&rdquo;. Penulis buku ini merupakan salah satu dosen yang aktif mengajar di Program Magister Hubungan Internasional FISIP Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta. Mari simak wawancara dan resensinya di bawah ini!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>Alifia Yumna Amri (AYA): Apa yang melatarbelakangi anda untuk menulis kasus-kasus dari berbagai macam essay terkait demokrasi dan moral politik, khususnya di Indonesia?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ahmad Sahide (AS): Saya menulis esai sejak awal kuliah Strata 1 di Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta. Saya mengasah kemampuan menulis dengan esai-esai. Dengan esai saya bisa merekam dan menganalisis peristiwa yang terjadi dari waktu ke waktu. Seiring dengan berjalannya waktu, saya sadar bahwa menulis esai penting karena bagian cara menjaga api ingatan sejarah. Kelak orang-orang akan mengerti apa yang terjadi pada waktu tertentu dengan membaca esai saya. Buku &ldquo;Demokrasi dan Moral Politik&rdquo; adalah lanjutan esai saya yang juga sudah saya terbitkan, yaitu &ldquo;Kebebasan dan Moralitas&rdquo;, terbit tahun 2010 dan 2013, kemudian &ldquo;Kekuasaan dan Moralitas&rdquo;, terbit tahun 2016. Tahun 2019 rencananya akan mempublish esai lanjutan dari buku ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(AYA): Melalui buku ini anda banyak membahas politik Indonesia pada masa SBY. Bagaimana kemudian pandangan anda terkait (demokrasi) Indonesia dibawah kepemimpinan SBY?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(AS): Tidak ada pemimpin yang sempurna di dunia ini. Selalu saja ada ketidakpuasan publik terhadap pemimpin itu. Dan SBY mengakhiri periode kepemimpinannya dengan tingkat kepuasan publik di atas 50 persen. SBY berhasil mengantarkan Indonesia dalam mengonsolidasikan demokrasi kita, tetapi banyak catatan buruk yang ditinggalkan SBY. Bank Century, Hambalang, dan beberapa kasus lainnya yang tentu akan dikenang oleh rakyat. SBY dipilih secara demokratis, tetapi beberapa langkah politiknya tidak demokratis, contohnya ketika dia merebut kursi ketua Umum Demokrati dari Anas Urbaningrum, kemudian juga merangkap sebagai ketua Dewan Kehormatan dan juga Ketua Dewan Pembina. Pada hakikatnya, ini kan tidak ada pembagian kekuasaan di internal Demokrat. Semua terpusat pada sosok SBY. Bagi saya, itu tidak demokratis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(AYA): Hal apa yang membuat anda tertarik untuk menelisik kasus-kasus yang menurut saya mencoreng nama bangsa?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(AS): Itu penting untuk kita abadikan sebagai bahan pembelajaran, sehingga ke depan tidak ada yang mengulangi. Perjalanan bangsa harus kita abadikan dan cara saya melakukan itu adalah dengan esai berkelanjutan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/8CRW-TYokf1f_xcg.jpg\" style=\"height:225px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image:</em> Ahmad Sahide.

DPR bagian dari Trias Politika untuk mengontrol dan mengawasi jalannnya roda pemerintahan agar supaya kebijakan yang diambil tetap bermuara pada kepentingan rakyat. Sayangnya, peran ini tidak berjalan dengan maksimal. Partai politik saling mengunci dan transaksi politik lebih dominan. Jika anggota DPR kita tidak menyadari hal ini, maka tunggu saja &lsquo;hukuman&rsquo; rakyat itu akan datang padanya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(AYA): Dalam dunia Internasional, seberapa besar peran media dalam mempengaruhi kebijakan suatu pemerintahan negara superpower terhadap negara less power?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(AS): Pemberitaan media tentu menjadi sangat penting dalam memengaruhi kebijakan yang diambil oleh setiap Negara di dunia. Kasus Jamal Khashoggi, jurnalis dan warga Negara Arab Saudi yang terbunuh di Istanbul mempengaruhi konstelasi politik dan ekonomi internasional. Arab Saudi terkucilkan karena peran pemberitaan media, beberapa negara mengecam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/J9YKqDvNq0LLOAhv.jpg\" style=\"height:225px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image:</em> Ahmad Sahide.

Melsasail</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Demokrasi dan Moral Politik, khususnya di Indonesia menjadi hal yang menarik untuk ditelisik. Demokrasi sendiri seringkali menjadi kata yang diagung-agungkan dalam perpolitikan di Indonesia. Demokrasi lekat dengan keinginan masyarakat dan sebenarnya juga berkaitan erat dengan kehendak &ldquo;pemerintah&rdquo;, pemerintah memiliki peran yang cukup besar terhadap terealisasikannya atau tidak kebutuhan rakyat. Semakin bertambahnya usia negara kita Indonesia, rakyat semakin sadar bahwa menjadi seorang individu di suatu negara yakni INDONESIA tidak cukup hanya mempercayakan masa depan bangsa terhadap jabatan-jabatan pemerintah. Semenjak munculnya Twitter dan Facebook nampaknya peran pemerintah telah tergantikan, DPR (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat) kini tak lagi menjadi penyambung lidah, keluh kesah dan derita rakyat Indonesia. Rakyat semakin cerdas mengkritisi kebijakan dan alur pemerintahan berdasarkan fakta-fakta yang ada, serta kerja nyata pemerintah yang seringkali bisa dikatakan &ldquo;tidak ada&rdquo;. DPR online adalah sebutan bagi sosial media semacam twitter dan facebook yang cukup menjadi tren pada masanya. Informasi yang tersedia pada laman sosial media tersebut lebih cepat dilihat rakyat, lebih cepat dipahami masyarakat yang seolah tersakiti. Besarnya minat rakyat Indonesia dalam menggunakan sosial media mampu memberikan berbagai macam citra pemerintahan dan mampu menekan pemerintahan untuk tidak mengeluarkan kebijakan- kebijakan tertentu termasuk rencana membangun fasilitas kantor pemerintahan di Senayan dengan budget yang begitu fantastis. Rakyat tidak akan menghina pemerintahan dengan kursi dan dekorasi ruang rapat yang sederhana, karena bagi rakyat pejuang adalah seberapa besar pengorbanan yang telah dilakukan dan sebanyak apa perubahan positif yang telah dihasilkan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Dalam sebuah kasus seperti Bahan Bakar Minyak (BBM), belum tentu DPR benar-benar mampu menyampaikan jeritan rakyat. Namun DPR online yang ditulis secara langsung oleh para rakyat nampaknya mampu menekan pemerintah untuk tidak mengeluarkan kebijakan dengan menaikan harga BBM, dari hal semacam itu kemudian sosial media memiliki perannya tersendiri dalam menyampaikan aspirasi. Selain adanya DPR online peran mahasiswa menjadi hal yang cukup menarik dalam menyuarakan dan meramaikan kata demokrasi dalam perpolitikan negeri ini. Pasalnya, mahasiswa dianggap sebagai golongan intelek yang memiliki gagasan maupun ide-ide untuk menyuarakan apa yang terbaik untuk bangsa ini. Sayangnya, semakin hari peran mahasiswa tidak terlihat lagi. Mahasiswa bukan lagi mereka yang berpendidikan dengan segudang ilmu melalui buku-buku, bukan lagi mereka yang berdiskusi dan mencari banyak solusi. Tapi, mahasiswa yang sibuk tergerus oleh milenial, kecanduan barang-barang digital dan tak lagi berani berbicara frontal. Mahasiswa merupakan salah satu bagian dari institusi pendidikan, yang diharapkan tidak hanya sekedar diajarkan tetapi dididik untuk menjadi yang terbaik dalam bagian masa depan bangsa. Sayangnya, institusi pendidikan kini bukanlah suatu tempat yang mendidik atau menciptakan moral, justru telah rusak oleh tindakan penyelewengan. Banyak ditemukan penjualan ijazah, plagiarisme bahkan dilakukan oleh tokoh-tokoh yang dianggap memiliki tataran yang cukup tinggi seperti profesor maupun doktor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/_PRvDe3GhwmFL43S.jpg\" style=\"height:294px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image:</em> Alifia Yumna Amri. Mahasiswi Hubungan Internasional</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Moral Politik Indonesia seharusnya dibangun dari pendidikan yang merupakan dasar terciptanya etika dan terciptanya budaya malu, kesalahan sistem pendidikan menciptakan budaya tersendiri bagi perpolitikan salah satunya adalah budaya korupsi, dimana tidak ada lagi rasa malu dan menjadikannya terlihat aneh jika perpolitikan tidak diikuti dengan kegiatan korupsi. Indonesia bisa dikatakan mengalami krisis perpolitikan, korupsi dimulai bahkan sejak pertama kali dana dianggarkan. Institusi pemberantas korupsi juga tidak luput dari serangan para koruptor, beberapa kali para pemerintah yang kenyang dengan &ldquo;hasil rampasan&rdquo; mengajukan dan mengkaji ulang Undang-Undang (UU) yang mengatur mengenai kebijakan dan wewenang Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (KPK) ke Mahkamah Konstitusi (MK) tapi mengalami penolakan. Hal ini karena, MK percaya bahwa, hanya orang-orang korup yang ingin membubarkan KPK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pembubaran tidak hanya mengancam KPK, tapi partai politik korup bisa saja dibaubarkan dengan melakukan dua hal yakni secara politik dan hukum. Dalam sejarah, Indonesia telah memiliki catatan membubarkan parpol secara politik pada masa Orde Baru (ORBA) namun hal ini dilakukan oleh pemerintah yang berkuasa pada saat itu. Dari catatan sejarah tersebut, bahwa partai politik (parpol) yang dibubarkan belum tentu merupakan parpol yang korup. Terkait dengan kuasa rakyat, sebagai negara yang mengagungkan demokrasi, sebenarnya Indonesia bisa saja menggulingkan parpol dengan cara tidak memilih partai-partai yang memiliki catatan sejarah sebagai parpol korup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Berbicara mengenai perpolitikan, tentu saja tidak jauh dari aktor para elit politik, citra politik yang mempengaruhi interpretasi masyarakat mengenai berbagai hal salah satunya adalah kata &ldquo;blusukan&rdquo;. Blusukan menjadi hal yang wajar dilakukan oleh salah satu mantan walikota Solo yang saat ini menjabat sebagai presiden. Namun, hal berbeda justru terlihat dari penilaian masyarakat jika hal itu dilakukan oleh SBY. SBY terkenal dengan citra politik yang ia buat, sehingga hal ini kemudian membangun interpretasi rakyat mengenai dirinya. Selian citra politik yang ia buat, SBY juga terkenal dengan bahasa politiknya yang penuh dengan penolakan apabila merasa tersaingi, sangat politis dan tersirat kalimat-kalimat dengan tujuan yang jelas. Beberapa diantaranya dapat dilihat dari penolakannya terhadap Jusuf Kalla, saat akan melakukan pemilihan periode kedua. Jusuf Kalla dianggap sebagai wakil presiden yang juga beberapa kali dianggap melanggar kebijakan presiden. Jusuf Kalla memiliki kekuatan dan ketegasan dalam mengambil keputusan, hal ini kemudian mendapatkan penolakan dari SBY. SBY memberikan beberapa syarat yang tidak bisa dipenuhi oleh Jusuf Kalla terkait posisinya, SBY akan mencari wakil yang bukan merupakan pemimpin parpol. Jusuf Kalla menyadari hal itu, meski sebenarnya ia ingin tetap berkolaborasi dengan SBY. Sehingga pada pemilu kedua, Jusuf Kalla berkolaborasi dengan Wiranto. Jika ditelisik lebih dalam mengenai latar belakang Jusuf Kalla, ia merupakan keturunan Makassar Bugis. Asal usul tersebut nampaknya juga memiliki pengaruh terhadap moral politik Indonesia, sirri na pesse merupakan salah satu tindakan yang dijunjung terkait &ldquo;perlawanan yang dilakukan apabila martabatnya dilanggar, tanpa rasa dendam&rdquo;. Hal inilah yang dilakukan Jusuf Kalla dalam rangka membuktikan dirinya terhadap SBY pada pemilu putaran kedua.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tidak hanya Jusuf Kalla, SBY juga melakukan penolakan terhadap Anas Urbaningrum pasca dirinya terlibat dalam kasus korupsi. Dalam bahasa politiknya, SBY mengatakan bahwa &ldquo;segala bentuk kewenangan Partai Demokrat hanya ada ditangan ketua partai dan SBY mengijinkan Anas untuk menemui dan menyelesaikan kasus hukum yang menjeratnya&rdquo; artinya adalah SBY tidak ingin ada orang yang sama berkuasanya dalam jabatannya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Politik di Indonesia memiliki banyak warna, selain aktor yang menduduki jabatan tertinggi. Indonesia juga memiliki perpolitikan yang menarik terkait pilkada di Jawa Barat. Para calon pemimpin yang mencalonkan diri justru banyak dipenuhi oleh artis papan atas, perpolitikan yang terjadi bukanlah kontestasi visi misi sebagai ide dan gagasan melainkan kontestasi popularitas. Disamping itu ada banyak hal lucu yang kemudian terjadi, ketika salah satu menteri perlindungan HAM yang kemudian melakukan tindak kekerasan terhadap penjaga pintu rumah tahanan dengan alasan harus menunggu 5 menit untuk dibukakan pintu. Hal ini dianggap kurang etis apabila seorang menteri harus menunggu. Kembali lagi jika melihat derita rakyat, untuk sekedar berobat mereka harus menunggu lama bahkan tanpa mendapatkan pelayanan apapun. Begitulah potret negeri ini, dipenuhi dengan berbagai macam kebudayaan-kebudayaan baru. Kebudayaan tidak hanya timbul dari latar belakang dan tindakan para aktornya, tapi produk asing nampaknya memiliki peran tersendiri. Salah satunya adalah munculnya produk HP dengan merk blackberry. Kemunculan produk blackberry sebagai alat komunikasi nampaknya juga turut memberikan kelas-kelas sosial, tidak hanya pada masyarakat namun juga terhadap pemerintahan. Pemerintah dengan menjaga privasinya khususnya terkait koordinasi mengenai dana korupsi, mereka menciptakan bahasa-bahasa baru seperti &ldquo;Apel Malang&rdquo; dan &ldquo;Apel Washington&rdquo; sebagai penyebutan mata uang Rupiah dan Dollar. Kebudayaan dapat dikatakan berkembang, salah satunya adalah dengan bertambahnya kosakata dari bangsa itu sendiri. Indonesia juga memiliki perkembangan kebudayaan, sayangnya budaya ini berkembang dari kasus korupsi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Kesimpulan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Demokrasi di suatu wilayah negara khususnya di Indonesia selalu diwarnai dengan latar belakang dan pola pikir masyarakatnya, hal ini juga terjadi pada moral politik suatu wilayah negara. Demokrasi dan moral politik yang terjadi, memiliki keterkaitan terhadap adanya latar belakang kebudayaan suatu individu yang berperan didalamnya. Hal ini terutama tercermin pada pemimpin atau pejabat elit politik di suatu wilayah tertentu. Perkembangan teknologi khususnya sosial media dan perkembangan alat komunikasi yang semakin canggih, turut mempengaruhi demokrasi dan moral politik suatu negara, hal ini karena sosial media dan alat komunikasi menjadi perantara yang memiliki peran bahkan mampu menggeser politikus yang menjabat di kursi pemerintahan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">Salatiga, 1 Desember 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">Pemberi Resensi,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><br />\r\nAlifia Yumna Amri<br />\r\n(Mahasiswi Semester 5 Hubungan Internasional Fakultas Ilmu Sosial dan Ilmu Politik Universitas Kristen Satya Wacana)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sebagai penutup, salah satu keistimewaan demokrasi adalah memberikan kebebasan berekspresi serta menyuarakan pendapat kepada warga Negara. Hal ini memungkinkan warga Negara untuk membentuk <em>pressure group</em> dan aktif melakukan control terhadap jalannya pemerintahan. Melalui jalan inilah mahasiswa/mahasiswi dapat memiliki keleluasaan untuk menjaga pemerintahan agar tetap &ldquo;waras&rdquo; dan bermoral. Jaga demokrasi kita, jaga moral politiknya, jaga Indonesia!

Prinsip non-intervensi yang ada di dalamnya menjadi salah satu penjaga keharmonisan antar Negara yang tergabung dalam organisasi ini. Pendekatan non-formal yang digunakan tampaknya mampu menjaga hubungan baik antar Negara tanpa mengesampingkan pentingnya menghormati kesepakatan-kesepakatan formal yang telah disepakati. Seiring dengan berjalannya waktu, sudah 50 tahun organisasi regional ini menjadi &ldquo;payung teduh&rdquo; bagi Negara-negara anggota ASEAN. Lalu apa saja kontribusinya bagi Negara-negara yang tergabung dalam organisasi ini khususnya Indonesia?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSebuah buku berjudul &ldquo;<em>50 Years of Amity and Enmity &ndash; The Politics of ASEAN Cooperation</em>&rdquo; hadir untuk memberikan penjelasan tentang kontribusi ASEAN terhadap Negara-negara anggotanya.

Mari simak wawancara hubunganinternasional.id bersama HI-<em>ma&rsquo;am</em> dan HI-<em>sir</em> berikut ini!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>Hubunganinternasional.id (hi.id): Apa yang melatarbelakangi penulisan buku ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Poppy S. Winanti &amp; Muhammad Rum (P.S.W &amp; M.R): <em>Pertama</em>, Buku ini diterbitkan untuk memperingati 50 tahun berdirinya ASEAN. Selama lima puluh tahun itu, regionalisme ini berkembang dari organisasi yang mulanya didirikan untuk tujuan geopolitik menjadi kerjasama di banyak bidang. Tata kelolanya juga membentuk pola yang unik, kira-kira seperti manifestasi kehidupan berkampung; ada ronda ada arisan dan lain-lain. Intinya mendukung guyub rukunnya negara anggota, jauh berbeda dengan Uni Eropa. Gaya berkonflik negeri-negeri Eropa ternyata berbeda. ASEAN bertahan selama 50 tahun dengan landasan menjaga harmoni, tetapi 50 tahunnya itu bukan tanpa masalah, banyak masalah sebetulnya, meski disapu ke bawah karpet diplomasi. Saling menyelamatkan reputasi masing-masing itu lah gaya ASEAN yang unik itu. Tetapi lambat laun kita temukan ada perubahan sedikit-sedikit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Kedua</em>, selama ini kita banyak membaca analisis mengenai ASEAN yang disajikan oleh para pemikir asal Eropa maupun Australia. Sehingga, kita berinisiatif untuk menghadirkan penilaian dan perspektif kita sendiri. Karena itu pula buku ini disusun dalam Bahasa Inggris. Ini yang hendak kami jadikan kekuatan, menilai ASEAN dari sudut pandang non-<em>Western</em>. Di samping itu, buku yang merupakan kumpulan tulisan ini juga bertujuan untuk mempertemukan pemikiran para peneliti, pengajar dan pemerhati ASEAN dari beberapa universitas di Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/85YjepEBt2e-cukB.jpg\" style=\"height:397px; width:312px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>image</em>: <a href=\"http://ugmpress.ugm.ac.id/en/product/sosial-politik/50-years-of-amity-and-enmity-the-politics-of-asean-cooperation\">http://ugmpress.ugm.ac.id/en/product/sosial-politik/50-years-of-amity-and-enmity-the-politics-of-asean-cooperatio</a>n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(hi.id): Prinsip non-intervensi sudah diadopsi sejak lama oleh ASEAN. Menurut pendapat anda bagaimana prinsip ini kemudian berkontribusi terhadap proses integrasi ASEAN?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(P.S.W &amp; M.R): Prinsip Non-Intervensi memiliki dua mata pisau. <em>Pertama</em>, prinsip itu mampu merekatkan negara-negara Asia Tenggara yang otoritarian maupun kurang demokratis itu menjadi satu. Misalnya, ketertarikan junta militer Myanmar untuk bergabung dengan ASEAN adalah mendapatkan lebih banyak legitimasi dan mereka tahu pelanggaran-pelanggaran HAM tidak akan dibahas di ASEAN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Kedua</em>, prinsip Non-Intervensi menghambat akselerasi kerjasama regional. Misalnya saja <em>ASEAN</em> <em>Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights</em> belum bisa bekerja maksimal karena institusinya dibatasi. Lalu, perkembangan <em>ASEAN Economic Community</em> (AEC) sampai saat ini masih terkendala karena setiap negara memiliki preferensi yang berbeda untuk melindungi ekonomi domestiknya seperti Malaysia saat ini melindungi Proton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(hi.id): Menurut pendapat anda, apa yang menjadi tantangan utama dalam mengintegrasikan ASEAN? Tolong jelaskan mengapa!</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(P.S.W &amp; M.R): Tantangan utama untuk mengintegrasikan ASEAN adalah pembangunan politik domestik yang demokratis di masing-masing negara. Adanya demokratisasi di negara-negara Asia Tenggara akan menjadikan ASEAN lebih terbuka terhadap gagasan-gagasan kritis yang mendukung regionalisme. Jika negara-negara Asia Tenggara dipimpin secara otoriter, mereka cenderung mempertahankan kenyamanan dengan tidak saling kritik satu sama lain. Tantangan lain untuk mengintegrasikan ASEAN adalah kurangnya ketergantungan secara ekonomi di antara sesama negara ASEAN. Secara ekonomi, negara-negara ASEAN masih bergantung pada kekuatan ekonomi di luar ASEAN seperti Cina, Jepang, Korea dan negara-negara Eropa maupun AS. Sesama negara ASEAN masih melihat anggota lain sebagai saingan ketimbang sebagai mitra yang bisa saling melengkapi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/4A9maYc2kFG0I-WI.jpg\" style=\"height:247px; width:430px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>image</em>: Poppy S.

Kerjasama sektor energi semestinya berangkat dari keperluan para pelakunya. Selain itu, perlu memberikan ruang bagi suara-suara dari masyarakat pada umumnya. Pada kerjasama penanganan bencana, negara-negara ASEAN mulai bekerjasama dengan lebih erat. Saat ini di bawah <em>ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response</em> (AADMER), negara yang terdampak bencana dapat meminta bantuan ASEAN dengan syarat bersedia untuk mengijinkan kapal-kapal perang, pesawat mau pun personel militer negara lain yang datang membawa bantuan dalam koordinasi ASEAN. AHA Center juga melatih para pejabat badan penanganan bencara negara-negara anggota agar terbiasa bekerjasama dan berkoordinasi satu sama lain dengan cepat dan efektif. Jika ada bencana pun, AHA Center bisa dengan cepat mengirimkan <em>Emergency Rapid Assessment Team</em> (ERAT) ke wilayah yang terdampak. Hasil-hasil itu dicapai bukan tanpa tarik ulur politik. Dulu di tahun 2008, negosiasi itu terjadi untuk kasus badai nargis di Myanmar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(hi.id): Integrasi ASEAN mendapatkan tantangan dari sengketa Laut China Selatan yang melibatkan sesama Negara ASEAN China. Bagaimana respon ASEAN terhadap kasus tersebut?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(P.S.W &amp; M.R): Belum ada pernyataan bersama dari negara-negara Asia Tenggara terkait Laut Cina Selatan akibat dari adanya perbedaan kepentingan yang cukup menonjol di antara sesama negara ASEAN. Misalnya, cukup tingginya kepentingan Kamboja dan Laos pada bantuan Cina tertutama jika dibandingkan dengan negara-negara ASEAN lainnya. Selama masih ada negara anggota yang berbeda pendapat, ASEAN tidak bisa berposisi tegas. Yang selama ini dilakukan adalah diplomasi ulang alik yang dilakukan para diplomat negara-negara ASEAN untuk mendekati Kamboja dan Laos. Selain kedua negeri itu belum memiliki keuntungan yang besar dari eksploitasi Laut Cina Selatan (Laos adalah negeri tanpa lautan), tanpa sumber bantuan alternatif terhadap ekonomi Kamboja dan Laos yang haus itu, agaknya sulit untuk membuat mereka peduli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/TjMfRhXCA0JQwI9t.jpg\" style=\"height:285px; width:380px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>image</em>: Muhammad Rum (Editor 50 Years of Amity and Enmity - The Politics of ASEAN Cooperation)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>source</em>: <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQai0igUQAA4-FR?format=jpg&amp;name=small\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQai0igUQAA4-FR?format=jpg&amp;name=small</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(hi.id): Bagaimaan anda melihat fungsi ASEAN selama 50 tahun masa eksistensinya dalam menjaga kepentingan nasional Indonesia?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(P.S.W &amp; M.R): ASEAN selalu disebut sebagai soko-guru politik luar negeri Indonesia. ASEAN juga adalah manifestasi dari <em>good neighbor policy</em> kita. Lingkungan yang maju dan damai adalah kepentingan Indonesia. Stabilitas keamanan regional telah memungkinkan Indonesia mendapatkan ruang untuk berkembang secara ekonomi. Ini yang diinginkan oleh Indonesia sejak penandatanganan deklarasi Bangkok pada 8 Agustus 1967. Bayangkan apabila Indonesia masih memiliki politik luar negeri yang konfrontatif dengan negara-negara tetangga, tentu anggaran negara kita dibebani oleh pembiayaan perang. Di sisi lain, cukup banyak kritik terhadap pemerintah Indonesia yang belakangan ini cenderung abai pada posisinya yang selama ini dipandang sebagai pemimpin tradisional atau kekuatan hegemoni ASEAN. Indonesia semestinya bisa mengambil peran yang lebih nyata di ASEAN. Kepemimpinan Indonesia diperlukan dalam mendorong proses integrasi ASEAN yang lebih berarti, di tengah persaingan AS dan Cina sebagai kekuatan ekonomi dunia yang mewarnai perkembangan ekonomi politik global kontemporer. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(hi.id): Terima kasih atas kebersediaan tim penulis untuk menjawab pertanyaan yang diajukan oleh tim hubunganinternasional.id.

Buku ini merupakan kumpulan tulisan yang disunting oleh Poppy S. Winanti dan Muhammad Rum dalam rangka memperingati ulang tahun ASEAN ke-50. Tujuan dari resensi ini adalah untuk memahami dan mengeksplorasi dinamika kerjasama ASEAN sejak awal berdirinya 50 tahun yang lalu dengan melihat isu-isu keamanan tradisional dan non tradisional serta isu-isu regionalism lainnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/WltHtgZRCLAspLGC.jpg\" style=\"height:533px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>: Arfin Sudirman. Pemberi resensi</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Dalam buku ini, saya melihat bahwasanya keseluruhan penulis mencoba untuk mengangkat fenomena regionalisme ASEAN yang selama 50 tahun ini didominasi oleh kesepakatan-kesepakatan kerjasama intra dan inter Kawasan yang cukup baik namun di sisi lain keniscayaan bahwa prinsip non-intervensi dan informalitas masih menjadi batasan atau<em> limitations </em>dalam memperdalam kerjasama ASEAN terutama di pilar pertama mengenai keamanan dan politik. Dalam beberapa kasus yang diangkat dalam buku ini, beberapa pilar kerjasama tampak lebih cair daripada pilar pertama. Meskipun kesepakatan-kesepakatan yang dibahas pada forum-forum pilar pertama sudah mulai menemukan kesamaan &ldquo;persepsi ancaman&rdquo; yang kolektif terutama jika membahas ancaman-ancaman yang bersifat non-tradisional dan transnasional. Hal ini menjadi penting melihat sifat alamiah dari ancaman-ancaman tersebut sudah tidak mengenal prinsip kedaulatan negara sehingga perlu penanggulangan secara kolektif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Para penulis dalam buku ini memberikan pemahaman fenomena 50 tahun dinamika kerjasama ASEAN secara komprehensif dari berbagai macam perspektif Hubungan Internasional. Umumnya penggunaan perspektif teori <em>regionalisme</em>, <em>global governance</em> seperti<em> functionalism</em>, <em>neo-functionalism</em>, <em>liberalism</em> hingga <em>konstruktivisme</em> digunakan untuk menganalisis berbagai fenomena dan dinamika kerjasama ASEAN hingga menemukan keunikan proses regionalisme ASEAN di berbagai bidang dan perbedaannya dengan organisasi regional lainnya. Misalnya dalam beberapa isu yang menyangkut kedaulatan dan sengketa perbatasan seperti kasus Indonesia dan Malaysia terdapat keengganan dari salah satu pihak untuk menyelesaikan permasalahan ini secara internal ASEAN karena dikhawatirkan pengaruh politik yang besar dari pihak yang bersengketa dapat mempengaruhi penyelesaian sengeketa wilayah tersebut hingga disepakati perlu adanya pihak di luar ASEAN yang memutuskan hal ini dengan mempertimbangkan netralitas dan objektifitasnya. Kasus-kasus seperti inilah yang kemudian memunculkan pesimisme dan limitasi kerjasama ASEAN yang meminjam istilah Phillipe C. Schmitter (1970) integrasi politik ASEAN hingga saat ini hanya pada tingkat &ldquo;<em>spill around</em>&rdquo; dimana luasnya isu yang dibahas di ASEAN melalui kesepakatan-kesepakatan tertulis tidak serta merta meningkatkan derajat otoritas ASEAN tersebut terhadap negara-negara anggotanya hingga integrasi bersifat supra nasional seperti Uni Eropa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Namun demikian, sekalipun banyak isu yang bersifat sensitif hingga tidak mungkin dikerjasamakan karena berbagai macam faktor baik eksternal maupun internal. Buku ini mencoba untuk menjawab pesimisme perwujudan integrasi total tersebut dengan mengangkat beberapa kerjasama ASEAN yang sudah berjalan di bidang-bidang ekonomi, energi, kesehatan dan lingkungan. Kerjasama-kerjasama ini berhasil memberikan paparan yang komprehensif mengenai beberapa bidang seperti AEC yang sudah menjadi kepentingan kolektif di ASEAN-yang dimana ini adalah tantangan dari semua kerjasama Kawasan di seluruh dunia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSecara keseluruhan, buku ini menarik dan sangat penting untuk dibaca oleh para penstudi Hubungan Internasional baik di Indonesia, ASEAN atau pun pemerhati ASEAN di seluruh dunia karena beragam isu mengenai dinamika politik ASEAN selama 50 tahun telah dibahas secara komprehensif di buku ini. Buku ini dapat menjadi referensi bagi para peneliti ASEAN meskipun buku ini masih bersifat <em>inward looking</em> karena tidak banyak menyinggung mengenai pengaruh aktor di luar Kawasan ASEAN terhadap dinamika kerjasama di dalam ASEAN namun hal tersebut tidak menutup keberhasilan buku ini dalam memaparkan perkembangan regionalisme di ASEAN. Buku ini sangat direkomendasikan bagi para mahasiswa, dosen dan periset yang tertarik pada kajian organisasi internasional dan regionalisme serta regional security khususnya di Kawasan ASEAN.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">Bandung, 05 Desember 2018<br />\r\nPemberi Resensi,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nArfin Sudirman<br />\r\n(Dosen Hubungan Internasional Fakultas Ilmu Sosial dan Ilmu Politik Universitas Padjadjaran)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sebagai penutup hubunganinternasional.id mempersilakan bagi para pembaca sekalian yang berminat untuk pesan buku&nbsp;50 Years of Amity and Enmity - The Politics of ASEAN Cooperation bisa langsung klik di <a href=\"http://ugmpress.ugm.ac.id/en/product/sosial-politik/50-years-of-amity-and-enmity-the-politics-of-asean-cooperation\">sini</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Wawancara dan Resensi Buku','Buku, ASEAN, Regionalisme, Cooperation','122018',2,1,690,NULL,1546146000,1546175796,1606936453,1,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,704),
(16,23,1,'Perbatasan dalam Studi Hubungan Internasional','',NULL,'<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tulisan Dikirim oleh: Niki Sayekti</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Editor: Randhi Satria</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Pendahuluan</strong><br />\r\nDalam pembahasan sebelumnya, telah diulas terkait pentingnya pengakuan dari negara lain sebagai salah satu syarat berdirinya negara. Namun, selain pengakuan dari negara lain, wilayah menjadi salah satu unsur krusial yang tentunya harus ada dari negara yang berdaulat. Wilayah suatu negara sendiri ditentukan oleh-oleh batas-batas tertentu, baik di darat, laut, maupun udara. Perbatasan tersebut menjadi penting bagi negara selain sebagai batas/penanda luas wilayah suatu negara, tetapi juga menyangkut banyak aspek lain dalam kehidupan bernegara seperti masalah ekonomi, sosial-budaya, keamanan, dan identitas/harga diri bangsa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Pembahasan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sebelum membahas terkait pentingnya perbatasan bagi kehidupan bernegara, pengertian dari perbatasan itu sendiri perlu untuk dipahami. Menurut beberapa pakar hukum internasional yaitu Green NA Maryan, Shaw Malcolm, JG Starke, dan Burhan Tsani, perbatasan negara diartikan sebagai batas terluar wilayah dari suatu negara berupa garis imajiner yang memisahkan wilayah negara satu dengan lainnya baik di darat, laut, maupun udara dimana perbatasan tersebut dapat dikategorikan dalam dua terminologi yaitu &ldquo;<em>Border Zone</em>&rdquo; (zona perbatasan) dan &ldquo;<em>Customs Free Zone</em>&rdquo; (zona bebas kepabeanan). (Seran, John Bernando). Oleh karena daerah perbatasan tersebut bersinggungan langsung dengan wilayah negara lain, hal tersebut tentu membuat wilayah perbatasan memainkan peran yang penting terkait hubungan ke luar suatu negara, akan tetapi juga memiliki peran yang tak kalah penting dalam hubungan ke dalam (urusan dalam negeri sendiri). Adapun pentingnya peran perbatasan dalam kehidupan bernegara dapat diuraikan dari beberapa aspek sebagai berikut:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>1. Aspek Politik dan Keamanan</strong><br />\r\nSecara politik, sebagaimana telah disinggung sebelumnya, wilayah perbatasan yang jelas tentunya merupakan hal yang wajib dipenuhi sebagai syarat terbentuknya suatu negara. Dengan penentuan batas wilayah yang jelas, suatu negara tentunya akan dapat mengetahui jangkauan wilayah dimana negara dapat mengenakan kekuasaannya yang bebas dari campur tangan dari negara luar karena wilayah tersebut merupakan daerah kedaulatannya. Disamping itu, karena berbatasan langsung dengan wilayah negara lain, wilayah perbatasan juga memiliki peran yang sangat signifikan dalam keamanan suatu negara. Kasus-kasus sengketa perbatasan antar negara sangatlah banyak di temui dalam hubungan internasional dimana salah satu contoh kasus yang paling rumit adalah kasus sengketa Laut China Selatan yang melibatkan Tiongkok dan beberapa negara ASEAN yaitu Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Filipina, dan Brunei Darussalam. Klaim yang tumpang tindih dari negara-negara tersebut atas batas wilayah di Laut China Selatan serta tidak adanya kesepahaman antara negara yang berselisih menjadi penyebab berlarut-larutnya sengketa tersebut. Akibatnya tentu membuat negara-negara yang terlibat sengketa menjadi harus lebih waspada terhadap keamanan negaranya. Tiongkok dan Vietnam seringkali berselisih paham dan menyebabkan hubungan keduanya menjadi panas karena beberapa kali kapal dari Tiongkok memasuki perairan dan membangun pulau-pulau buatan di teritori sengketa yang juga diklaim oleh Vietnam. Tiongkok juga menjadi ancaman bagi Indonesia dimana klaimnya atas Laut China Selatan sampai menyentuh wilayah perairan Natuna milik Indonesia. Contoh lainnya yaitu upaya TNI AL Pengamanan Perbatasan (Pamtas) Laut Koarmatim Wilayah Laut Republik Indonesia (RI) &ndash; Republik Demokratik Timor Leste (RDTL) &ndash; Australia dalam upaya mengatasi masalah klaim batas wilayah, perompakan, pembajakan, illegal entry, penyelundupan narkoba, dan lain-lain. Contoh lainnya lagi yang juga banyak menjadi perbincangan yaitu upaya Presiden Amerika Serikat, Donald Trump, dalam membangun pagar pembatas di wilayah perbatasan antara Amerika Serikat dan Meksiko untuk membendung arus kedatangan imigran, penyelundupan narkoba, dan terorisme yang dianggap sebagai ancaman untuk Amerika Serikat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Ilustrasi Tembok Pembatas yang Ingin Dibangun oleh Donald Trump di Perbatasan Amerika Serikat - Meksiko</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/snYx033swsGSvFCT.png\" style=\"height:296px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image:</em> <span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size:11.0pt\"><a href=\"http://jacobanglais.over-blog.com/article-terminales-topic-3-spaces-and-exchanges-114853958.html\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size:12.0pt\">http://jacobanglais.over-blog.com/article-terminales-topic-3-spaces-and-exchanges-114853958.html</span></a></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2. Aspek Ekonomi dan Kesejahteraan</strong><br />\r\nBatas wilayah juga memainkan peran penting dalam mengamankan kepentingan ekonomi suatu negara dalam rangka meningkatkan kesejahteraan rakyatnya. Kepentingan ekonomi yang dimaksud disini sebagai contoh adalah Sumber Daya Alam (SDA) yang dimiliki suatu negara. Dengan batas negara yang sudah jelas, tentunya negara luar tidak berhak untuk mengambil kekayaan alam/SDA dari wilayah negara lain. Masih mengambil contoh dari kasus sengketa Laut China Selatan, dapat dilihat bahwa negara-negara yang terlibat tersebut selain ingin melindungi teritori negaranya juga ingin mengamankan kepentingan ekonominya di Laut China Selatan. Adapun salah satu alasan kuat negara-negara tersebut memperebutkan wilayah Laut China Selatan yaitu karena perairan tersebut disinyalir memiliki sumber cadangan minyak dan sumber daya ikan yang melimpah.Sebagai salah satu negara yang terlibat dalam sengketa ini, Indonesia sendiri berusaha untuk mengamankan wilayah perairan Natuna, yang kaya akan sumber minyak, dari klaim dan ancaman Tiongkok. Contoh lain yaitu upaya TNI AL, yang juga bekerjasama dengan Kementerian Kelautan dan Perikanan (KKP), dalam menjaga wilayah laut. Selain untuk menjaga daerah kedaulatan Indonesia, TNI AL juga mengamankan perbatasan laut tentunya dalam rangka melindungi sumber daya ikan Indonesia dari oknum-oknum pencuri ikan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Ilustrasi Sengketa Perbatasan di Perairan Laut China Selatan</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/Pn6ays8QDcO6IV1p.jpg\" style=\"height:299px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image: </em> <span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size:11.0pt\"><a href=\"https://athrillingshow.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/territorial-disputes-in-the-south-china-sea/\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size:12.0pt\">https://athrillingshow.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/territorial-disputes-in-the-south-china-sea/</span></a></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>3. Aspek Sosial-Budaya</strong><br />\r\nSelain dari segi politik keamanan dan ekonomi, batas wilayah juga berperan dalam aspek sosial dan budaya. Sebagai daerah terluar dari suatu negara, tentunya wilayah perbatasan dapat dinilai sebagai refleksi di negara tersebut. Sebagaimana disampaikan oleh Presiden Republik Indonesia, Joko Widodo, yang menyatakan bahwa wilayah perbatasan menunjukkan kebanggaan dan wajah bangsa Indonesia. Batas wilayah tersebut berperan dalam menjaga dan mempertahankan budaya dan identitas nasional suatu bangsa. Untuk mempertahankan identitas nasional dan kepercayaan rakyat di daerah perbatasan, pemerintah suatu negara sudah seharusnya memberikan perhatian yang cukup untuk daerah perbatasan. Di era pemerintahan presiden Joko Widodo, perhatian tersebut dilaksanakan dengan renovasi atau pembangunan Pos Lintas Batas Negara (PLBN), yang salah satunya yaitu di perbatasan Indonesia dan Timor Leste di wilayah Motaain, NTT. Dengan dibangunnya PLBN tersebut menjadi jauh lebih baik dan megah tentunya akan menimbulkan rasa kebanggaan sebagai bangsa Indonesia pada pribadi masyarakat di perbatasan sana. Seiring dengan tumbuhnya rasa kebanggaan tersebut tentunya semangat nasionalisme yang ada pada rakyat di daerah perbatasan akan tetap kuat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Analogi Sederhana Perbatasan</strong><br />\r\nSebagai contoh dan analogi sederhana, pentingnya perbatasan ini dapat dilihat dan dipahami dalam kehidupan sehari-hari yaitu bertetangga. Dalam hubungan bertetangga, antara rumah satu dan rumah lainnya pastinya terdapat batas-batas wilayah yang jelas dan sudah ditentukan. Batas wilayah antar rumah satu dan yang lain tersebut dapat ditandai dengan adanya pagar, pohon, sumur, ataupun hal lainnya sebagai patokan. Sebagai contoh apabila terdapat pohon mangga di wilayah pekarangan rumah A, tentu saja hak milik dan hak untuk memanen mangga tersebut adalah milik rumah A. Rumah B ataupun yang lainnya tidak boleh mengambil ataupun memanen mangga dari pohon tersebut secara sepihak karena pohon mangga tersebut berada di pekarangan/kedaulatan rumah A, dan begitu pula sebaliknya. Dalam kehidupan bertetangga pun sering ditemui adanya konflik atau sengketa terkait batas lahan/tanah dimana terdapat klaim yang saling tumpang tindih antara satu rumah dengan rumah lainnya. Upaya penyelesaian sengketa tersebut pun bisa beragam mulai dari perundingan dan mediasi, pengaduan atau pelaporan ke Kantor Pertanahan ataupun sampai ke tingkat pengadilan. Sama halnya dengan kasus sengketa antar negara dimana apabila tidak tercapai kesepahaman, negara dapat membawa kasus sengketa tersebut ke Mahkamah Internasional. Apabila proses penyelesaian sengketa tidak menemukan titik temu, maka potensi terjadinya konflik fisik antar kedua belah pihak bisa meningkat atau dengan kata lain bisa saja terjadi perang antar Negara terkait batas wilayah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simak video berikut ini:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_nLPsFeSw4Y\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nLPsFeSw4Y\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nLPsFeSw4Y</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Kesimpulan</strong><br />\r\nDari pembahasan singkat diatas, dapat disimpulkan bahwa selain menjadi salah satu unsur utama bagi berdirinya sebuah negara yang berdaulat, perbatasan negara juga memainkan peran yang sangat penting dalam bernegara. Peran tersebut meliputi beberapa aspek antara lain aspek politik keamanan, ekonomi, dan sosial budaya. Oleh karena itu, penting bagi pemerintah untuk memberikan perhatian dan perlakuaan yang cukup bagi daerah-daerah perbatasan karena pada dasarnya daerah-daerah perbatasan tersebut merupakan salah satu faktor penting yang mempengaruhi keberlangsungan hidup suatu negara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bahan Bacaan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>________. &ldquo;Laut yang Disengketakan: Konflik dan Diplomasi di Laut.&rdquo; VOA News.

Begitu pula dalam Studi Hubungan Internasional yang tentunya memiliki sejumlah teori yang wajib untuk dipelajari dan dipahami. Dalam perkuliahan biasanya mahasiswa/i akan mendapatkan serangkaian teori dari berbagai pendekatan yang berbeda. Mempelajari terlebih memahaminya menjadi hal yang sangat penting sehingga dapat menghindari dari gagal paham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sebuah buku dengan judul &ldquo;<em>Teori Hubungan Internasional (Perspektif-Perspektif Klasik)</em>&rdquo; hadir dan mencoba memberikan beberapa teori dari pendekatan yang berbeda untuk mempelajari dan memahami Hubungan Internasional. Buku ini merupakan karangan dari HI-<em>sir</em> dan HI-<em>ma&rsquo;am</em> yang berasal dari Universitas Airlangga Surabaya. Hubunganinternasional.id mencoba menghubungi salah satu tim penulis yang bernama Vinsensio Dugis Ph.D yang juga bertindak selaku editor dari buku ini untuk bertanya lebih lanjut.

Tantangan tersebut adalah ketidaktersediaan sumber bacaan yang memudahkan bagi mahasiswa tingkat awal untuk memahami THI. Sumber bacaan sudah banyak, tetapi umumnya bukan dalam bahasa Indonesia dan mensyaratkan tingkat pemahaman yang mengarah pada aplikasi. Akibatnya banyak mahasiswa tingkat awal kesulitan di dalam memahami materi kuliah THI. Karena itu, buku ini ditulis dengan bahasa yang lebih mudah dipahami mahasiswa pemula, dimaksudkan untuk mempermudah mereka mengenal teori-teori dalam disiplin Ilmu Hubungan Internasional (HI) sebelum para mahasiswa mengeksplorasi kajian teori pada level yang lebih tinggi melalui sumber-sumber bacaan yang lebih luas. Karena itu, buku ini sifatnya memang ebih sebagai sebuah pengantar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/PQ8bsAYtGE2WdJSx.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>sumber: </em><a href=\"http://catalog.aup.unair.ac.id/sosial/305-teori-hubungan-internasional.html?search_query=teori+hubungan+internasional&amp;results=13\">http://catalog.aup.unair.ac.id/sosial/305-teori-hubungan-internasional.html?search_query=teori+hubungan+internasional&amp;results=13</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(hi.id): Bisa tolong anda jelaskan kepada pembaca, mengapa mempelajari teori itu penting?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(V.D): Mempelajari teori itu penting, apalagi di dalam disiplin IHI, karena begitu banyak indormasi dan fakta hubungan global yang setiap saat kita hadapi. Perkembangan teknologi di era globalisasi saat ini bahkan membuat perubahan dimana bukan kita yang mencari informasi, tetapi informasi yang hadir memburu kita dimanapun kita berdiam. Untuk itu kita membutuhkan alat yang kita sebut teori untuk dapat memberi makna (mendeskripsikan, menjelaskan, dan bahkan mungkin memprediksi) terhadap informasi dan fakta yang kita terima. Tanpa teori, maka informasi dan fakta yang kita terima tidak akan mempunyai makna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(hi.id): Teori-teori yang anda tuliskan di dalam buku ini merupakan teori dari perspektif klasik. Mengapa anda memilih perspektif klasik?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(V.D): Perspektif klasik ini penting karena jangkauan formula penjelasan yang ditawarkan cukup luas, juga menjadi dasar di dalam &#39;melahirkan&#39; teori-teori baru yang umumnya disebut&nbsp; Perspektif-Perspektif Alternatif. Hal yang unik di dalam disipin IHI adalah, kita tidak pernah dapat memahami teori-teori alternatif tanpa memahami dulu dalil-dalil perspektif klasik. Saya dan sejumlah penulis saat ini sedang berupaya menulis buku kedua yang isinya teori-teori alternatif yang mudah-mudahan tahun ini bisa terbit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(hi.id): Mengajarkan teori kepada mahasiswa/i merupakan salah satu tantangan tersendiri bagi dosen.

Mahasiswa juga harus diberi kesempatan membaca materi lebih dahulu, mendiskusikan dengan sesama teman mahasiswa, lalu menyajikanya dalam bentuk presentasi di kelas. Kuliah diberi sebagai rangkuman. Tidak kalah penting ialah kewajiban bagi mahasiswa untuk membuat rangkuman materi dengan bahasa mereka sendiri. Pemahaman ini akan memudahkan mereka di tingkat-tingkat yang lebih tinggi setelah itu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/276KAT3aaF6dJU8W.jpg\" style=\"height:423px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image: </em>Vincensio Dugis (Editor Buku Teori Hubungan Internasional Perspektif-Perspektif Klasik)<em>.

Ini menjadi saah satu indikator perkembangan disiplin IHI. Sudah banyak substansi disiplin IHI yang bergeser dari legasi <em>Westhpalian</em> akibat perkembangan globalisasi. Karena itu diperlukan reorientasi pemaknaan substansi hubungan internasional kontemporer, yang kebetulan di tempat kami sudah kami lakukan. Disiplin IHI sudah harus dikembangkan sebagai kombinasi antara <em>Science</em> dan <em>Art</em>. Dampaknya adalah, munculnya teori-teori baru yang tidak saja berbasis barat, tetapi juga mengedepankan cara pandang lainnya. Saya dan sejumlah kolega sedang merintis untuk menuangkan interpretasi baru kami tentang disiplin IHI dan teori-teori yang mengikutinya.

Pada awal buku ini terdapat pembahasan mendalam tentang hal yang dibutuhkan dalam kajian studi Hubungan Internasional seperti tipologi, nomenklatur, dan epistemologi dalam dunia Hubungan Internasional. Pada awal bab dijabarkan apa itu teori, lalu apakah teori dalam hubungan internasional itu, dan kegunaan teori-teori dalam hubungan internasional sehingga kita dapat memahami secara utuh apa yang diperlukan untuk mempelajari dan menerapkan ilmu dalam Hubungan Internasional sebagai bidang studi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Terdapat kepedulian yang tinggi terhadap perkembangan studi Hubungan Internasional, kepedulian ini ditunjukan dengan bahasa yang mudah diingat dan keruntutan juga konsistensi penulisan dalam tiap paragraf yang mengakomodasi proses pemahaman kita terhadap suatu teori maupun fenomena dalam hubungan internasional. Buku ini tepat untuk mengawali pembelajaran dalam studi Hubungan Internasional secara mendalam dan komprehensif, karena buku ini tidak hanya menawarkan pemahaman dalam bentuk pengenalan. Namun, buku ini juga mengangkat suatu pembahasan yang mendalam dan memunculkan interaksi antara buku dengan pembaca.&nbsp; Buku ini memastikan pembacanya memahami hal yang ditawarkan dalam buku, baik dari segi epistemologis, aksiologis, dan ontologis dari elemen-elemen pembentuk Hubungan Internasional sekarang ini yang diterangkan dalam setiap bab dan turunannya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Fitur-fitur yang dibutuhkan untuk mempelajari dan mengambil keputusan dalam hubungan internasional, bukan hanya studi hubungan internasional, dijelaskan secara padat, konsisten, dan diarahkan dengan pembahasan yang memunculkan interaksi antara buku dan pembaca. Sehingga pada saat membaca muncul proses berpikir akan apa yang sebenarnya buku ini ungkapkan dan apa hakikat dari gagasan tersebut. Pada buku ini, pendekatan historis dalam menjelaskan suatu teori disampaikan secara teliti dan selektif untuk memudahkan pemahaman dan membuat pembaca tidak keluar dari jalur pemikiran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/hJaWOxMPKsRh9ixD.jpg\" style=\"height:340px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image:</em> Tedjo Cahyadi, Pemberi Resensi. <em>dok: </em>Tedjo Cahyadi</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPenjelasan yang diberikan oleh para penulis menimbulkan diskursus antara pembaca dan buku, seperti dalam sub-bab marxisme &ldquo;Potret Hubungan Internasional dan Relevansi Kontemporer Marxisme&rdquo; yang ditulis oleh salah satu penulis, Baiq Wardhani, menerangkan bahwasanya beberapa permasalahan dalam dunia yang kontemporer yang luas ini masih dapat dianalisis dengan perspektif Marxisme dimana dalam salah satu point yang beliau terangkan, bahwasanya kita dapat menganalisis perang melawan terorisme sampai konflik etnis dengan perspektif Marxisme, yang tentu gagasan dalam buku ini membantu kita sebagai Bangsa Indonesia untuk menyumbangkan pemikiran dalam kasus yang melanda negeri ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Buku ini tidak hanya sebagai sumber bacaan untuk dipelajari, melainkan juga sarana mengembangkan kemampuan berpikir untuk mengeksplorasi seberapa dalam kita berpikir.

Interaksi antara bangsa Indonesia dengan bangsa lain menjadi penting dalam pembahasan diplomasi Indonesia di era sekarang. <em>Pertama</em>, interaksi tersebut dapat menunjukkan kemajuan peradaban Indonesia di tengah kekuatan global. <em>Kedua</em>, pengungkapan fakta bahwa Indonesia bukanlah bangsa yang dijajah selama 350 tahun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kalau kita merujuk pada kerjasama antara kerajaan Aceh dengan Amerika pada tahun 1873, maka kita bisa melihat bagaimana kedudukan kerajaan Aceh yang memang memiliki kemerdekaan. Selain itu, pada tahun 1681, utusan Sultan Banten juga telah melakukan kontak dengan Inggris untuk bekerjasama. Sultan banten mengirimkan persembahan kepada raja Charles II untuk mendapatkan meriam raksasa yang bisa digunakan untuk melawan Belanda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gambaran ini kami anggap akan memberikan fondasi bagi pemikir dan pengamat politik luar negeri mengenai bagaimana Indonesia saat ini. Misalnya saja kedekatan Indonesia - China atau Indonesia - India yang sebenarnya telah kita lakukan sebelum kemerdekaan. Dengan kedua negara ini kita telah memiliki sentuhan diplomasi dalam budaya dan ekonomi. Begitupun fondasi bagi politik luar negeri indonesia di ASEAN, sebenarnya kita bisa menelusuri melalui sentuhan diplomatik era kerajaan seperti kerajaan Sriwijaya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(hi.id): Diplomasi Indonesia mencapai level tertinggi pada saat mengusung semangat anti-imperialism dan anti-colonialism yang ditunjukkan dengan keberhasilan Indonesia merangkul Negara-negara terjajah dalam Konfrensi Asia-Afrika (KAA) dan menjadi pemimpin Gerakan Non Blok. Bagaimana anda melihat pencapaian diplomasi Indonesia ketika itu?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(A.H): Menjadi tuan rumah KAA adalah warisan diplomasi era Soekarno yang kita nikmati hingga saat ini. Anda bisa bayangkan di tahun 1954-1955, Indonesia merupakan negara yang secara ekonomi belum mapan namun mampu menghadirkan negara - negara Asia Afrika untuk hadir di Bandung. Padahal, pada waktu itu ada India dengan Nehru sebagai tokoh yang juga sebenarnya memiliki keinginan untuk menjadi tuan rumah. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kehadiran negara - negara Asia Afrika di Bandung bukan perkara mudah. Ada perdebatan tersendiri dalam beberapa kasus, misalnya soal siapa saja yang dapat menjadi peserta konferensi. Contohnya Anda dapat baca secara detail di buku kami mengenai kehadiran China dalam KAA. Ada beberapa negara yang menolak, namun ada beberapa negara juga yang mendukung. Indonesia kemudian tampil sebagai penengah dengan melobi negara - negara Arab yang juga berkomitmen akan hadir dalam KAA. Kehadiran negara - negara dengan berbagai ideologi namun dapat disatukan oleh Indonesia dengan semangat anti imperialisme dan anti kolonialisme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/OvQ6RG5FoE_0jJFN.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:275px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: <a href=\"https://petramas.co.id/product/diplomasi-indonesia-realitas-dan-prospek-b4dd\">https://petramas.co.id/product/diplomasi-indonesia-realitas-dan-prospek-b4dd</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>(hi.id): Seiring dengan pergantian Orde Lama ke Orde Baru, Diplomasi Indonesia pun mengalami perubahan arah. Tolong anda jelaskan, apa hal paling fundamental yang membedakan diplomasi Indonesia pada masa Orde Lama dan Orde Baru?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(A.H): Di buku ini, Anda dapat menemukan perbedaan prioritas politik luar negeri Soekarno dan Soeharto. Soekarno menempatkan memperoleh pengakuan dunia internasional sebagai hal yang paling penting. Oleh karena itu, dia tidak mau untuk mendirikan organisasi regional di tingkat Asia Tenggara dan lebih memilih menyelenggarakan KAA. Karena memang persoalannya adalah eksistensi Indonesia sebagai negara merdeka dipertanyakan di dunia internasional. Indonesia memerlukan pengakuan dari sebanyak - banyaknya negara mengenai kemerdekaannya. Jika Soekarno hanya berfokus pada Asia Tenggara, maka hanya akan sedikit pengakuan dari negara lain atas kemerdekaan Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sedangkan Soeharto tidak memiliki persoalan pengakuan dunia internasional. Tantangan Soeharto memang pembangunan. Oleh karena itu, langkah yang dipilih adalah kerja sama dengan dunia internasional, dimulai dengan normalisasi hubungan dengan Malaysia dan kembali menjadi anggota PBB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warisan dari politik luar negeri Soeharto yang bisa kita lihat dan nikmati saat ini adalah ASEAN.&nbsp; Sampai saat ini, Indonesia menempatkan ASEAN dalam konsentris pertama politik luar negeri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(hi.id): Memasuki Era Reformasi, Indonesia mulai menerapkan &ldquo;zero enemy, thousand friends&rdquo; bagaimana pendapat anda terhadap konsep diplomasi ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(A.H): Sebenarnya &ldquo;<em>zero enemy, thousand friends</em>&rdquo; adalah penerapan politik luar negeri di bawah SBY (Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, ed) yang mana Indonesia menggabungkan independensi dan diplomasi aktif&nbsp; dengan memegang prinsip untuk tidak menganggap siapa pun sebagai musuh dan mencari kawan sebanyak-banyaknya. Arah politik luar negeri tersebut menggantikan doktrin politik luar negeri yang dicetuskan oleh Muhammad Hatta &ldquo;berlayar di antara dua karang&rdquo;. Untuk saat ini, Doktrin Hatta mulai kehilangan konteksnya karena absurdnya pandangan adanya dua kekuatan utama dunia, terutama pasca-bubarnya Uni Soviet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><em>(hi.id): Bagaimana anda menjelaskan diplomasi Indonesia saat ini?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(A.H): Jika kita mengulas politik luar negeri&nbsp; Joko Widodo (Jokowi), maka kita dapat melihat dalam pidato pelantikannya sebagai presiden, Joko Widodo menekankan politik luar negeri Indonesia bersandar pada maritim atau yang kemudian dikenal sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia (PMD). Joko Widodo, kembali mengingatkan betapa Indonesia merupakan negara yang memiliki potensi besar di bidang kelautan. Indonesia bertekad menjadi Poros Maritim Dunia dengan lima pilar yaitu membangun budaya maritim, mengelola potensi sumber daya laut, mengembangkan infrastruktur untuk konektivitas maritim, melakukan kerja sama dalam bidang maritim, dan membangun kekuatan pertahanan maritim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Menlu Retno juga menyatakan hal yang lebih spesifik mengenai bagaimana diplomasi Indonesia yang dijalankan saat ini, yaitu (1) Diplomasi Indonesia akan menonjolkan karakter sebagai Negara maritim, (2) Diplomasi Indonesia akan terkoneksi dengan kepentingan rakyat (<em>diplomacy for the people</em>), (3) Diplomasi Indonesia akan membumi (<em>down to earth</em>), dan (4) Diplomasi Indonesia akan dilakukan secara tegas dan bermartabat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meski sudah dicanangkan sedemikian rupa, ternyata dalam mengimplementasikan tidaklah mudah. Kami menyoroti beberapa persoalan misalnya Laut China Selatan untuk mewakili prioritas polugri (Politik Luar Negeri,<em> </em>ed) dalam isu maritim dan perlindungan WNI (Warga Negara Indonesia, ed) sebagai diplomasi membumi. Meskipun Indonesia tidak menyatakan sebagai pengklaim di Laut China Selatan, namun perairan Indonesia di Natuna akan terdampak atas hasil akhir klaim China atas Laut China Selatan. Kemudian persoalan perlindungan WNI-termasuk buruh migran-yang menjadi prioritas pemerintah juga menghadapi tantangan tersendiri yaitu tidak semua negara meratifikasi perlindungan pekerja migran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/yT76Kv1c7-amhbr0.jpg\" style=\"height:267px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: Agus Haryanto, Penulis Buku Diplomasi Indonesia - Realitas dan Prospek.

Ada banyak pembelajaran dari diplomasi di pemerintahan sebelumnya. Soekarno seringkali disebut memiliki profil diplomasi <em>high profile</em>, sementara Soeharto mewakili diplomasi <em>low profile</em>. Di era Soekarno, kita memiliki profil politik luar negeri yang sangat baik, namun tidak diimbangi dengan perekonomian. Sedangkan di Era Soeharto, kita memiliki pertumbuhan ekonomi yang baik, namun profil politik luar negeri kita tidak seperti era Soekarno.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jika kita melihat Indonesia saat ini, kita adalah negara dengan populasi terbesar keempat di dunia, negara demokrasi ketiga di dunia, dan negara berpenduduk muslim terbesar. Satu lagi, perekonomian kita juga terus bertumbuh dengan baik sehingga saat ini kita menempati 15 perekonomian terbesar dunia.

Kita bersyukur bahwa selama 40 tahun terakhir di kawasan Asia Tengara ini menikmati suasana damai. Tetapi suasana damai ini tidak datang dengan sendirinya, melainkan adanya upaya diplomasi. Diplomasi yang telah dimulai dari Nusantara hingga menciptakan Indonesia yang aman dibahas secara runtut di dalam buku ini. Buku ini mengajak pembacanya untuk melihat kembali bagaimana sentuhan diplomasi dari Era Kerajaan hingga mencapai titik politik luar negeri di era sekarang dan merangkum semua point pentingnya sebagai <em>lesson learned</em>. Sehingga kita dapat memahami secara utuh serta berkaca pada perjalanan sejarah bangsa dalam melakukan diplomasi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buku ini dapat menjadi acuan bagi mahasiswa dalam memahami penyelesaian konflik dan realitas diplomasi di dalam dinamika Hubungan Internasional. Karena itulah, buku ini bagi saya tidak hanya sekadar bercerita namun banyak paradigma dalam sejarah nasional yang dipaparkan pada buku ini sehingga bisa menjadi starting point bagi mahasiswa dalam memahami upaya diplomasi dalam kajian Hubungan Internasional atau dinamika isu politik global.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buku ini menurut saya merupakan bahan bacaan bagi mereka yang ingin memahami perjalanan diplomasi sejak era nusantara hingga era politik luar negeri sekarang, selain itu juga sebagai pemahaman dasar tentang diplomasi Indonesia secara lebih mendalam khususnya bagi kajian Hubungan Internasional karena buku ini dibentuk untuk memberikan sebuah pemahaman dan informasi secara lebih jelas kepada pembaca mengenai sebuah karya perjalanan diplomasi Indonesia yang telah dibahas secara komprehensif di dalam buku ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/Ikb-WZBxnVj7uXJb.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: Anastasia Kintan, Pemberi Resensi.

PLN AS era Obama, sebagai misal, merupakan peralihan dari PLN AS era Bush yang terobsesi dengan perang melawan teror dan promosi demokrasi dan HAM berakhir dengan tragis. Kondisi ekonomi AS pada tahun terakhir Bush dan saat Obama terpilih sangat buruk (resesi ekonomi) sebagai akibat belanja militer yg sangat besar dan tidak terkendali selama Bush melakukan kampanye melawan teror dengan menggelar perang di Afghanistan dan di Iraq. Dua perang besar inilah yang menyedot keuangan AS tanpa ada usaha pengembangan ekonomi yang sepadan dengan kebutuhan saat itu. Sementara PLN AS era Trump juga tak kalah menarik karena merupakan upaya menjawab krisis ekonomi yang dialami AS selama 8 tahun perang melawan teror dan 8 tahun berikutnya yang belum menunjukan perbaikan berarti. Trump dengan segala hiruk pikuknya mencoba menciptakan lapangan kerja bagi buruh kulit putih.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(A.S): Menurut pendapat Anda, apakah kebijakan &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo; milik Trump merupakan hal yang tepat dilakukan dalam menghadapi dunia global?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(Prof. B.C): Kebijakan itu tepat bagi AS saat ini karena selama Obama memimpin ekonomi kurang tumbuh bagus. Dengan kebijakan Trump paling tidak ekonomi AS membaik dan bahkan AS kembali menjadi negara paling kompetitif secara ekonomi. Ini fakta yang cukup kuat mendukung kebijakan Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(A.S): Kemunduran AS di level internasional tentu akan dimanfaatkan oleh pihak lain, siapa (negara mana) yang menurut anda paling memungkinkan untuk mengambil kesempatan dari kondisi ini?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(Prof. B.C): Ironis bahwa disatu pihak ekonomi AS tumbuh bagus dimasa Trump, tapi Trump sendiri cenderung mengisolir AS dari dunia internasional. Sejak awal Trump telah mundur dari TPP sehingga TPP pun tak jelas perkembanganya saat ini. Trump juga mundur dari Paris Accord (sesuai janji kampanye) karena Senat yang didominasi Republiken tidak meratifikasi Paris Accord. Kemumduran AS dari dunia internasioanal tampaknya sedang dimanfaatkan China untuk merebut status superpower dengan menggenjot berbagai kekuatan nasional China yang akibatnya mengundang Perang Dagang yang belum berakhir hingga kini. Bahkan Perang Dagang berpotensi menjadi Perang Dingin Kedua dengan penangkapan putri pemilik Huawei, perusahaan telekom terbesar di dunia saat ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(A.S): Menurut Anda, bagaimana keunggulan politik luar negeri Obama dibandingkan Trump?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(Prof. B.C): Obama mampu memenuhi janji kampanye dengan menarik pasukan dari Iraq. Obama cenderung tidak bersedia melakukan petualangan militer sebagaimana Bush sehingga tidak menciptakan krisis ekonomi sebagaimana Bush pada akhir jabatanya tahun 2008. Obama mengarahkan politik luar negeri AS lebih ke Asia melalui Pivot to Asia namun kehilangan momentum karena habisnya masa jabatan presidem. Trump walaupun secara ekonomi sukses namun gagal memanfaatkan China sebagai rekanan dagang yang sesungguhnya berpotensi meningkatkan ekonomi AS jauh lebih&nbsp; baik jika mampu mmelihara hubungan&nbsp; baik dengan China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/fzBY9B6lno2mkwV4.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image:</em> Prof. Dr. Bambang Cipto M.A, Penulis Politik Global Amerika Dari Obama ke Trump.

Sebenarnya dunia masih berharap agar AS kembali memainkan peran internasional sebagaimana sebelum Trump terpilih. Akan tetapi tampaknya Trump maih masih menabrak dinding tebal sehingga masih berusaha mencari jalan keluar untuk terus membangun tembok isolasionis. Sesuatu yang merupakan isyarat bahwa AS telah kehilangan international leadership yang selama ini disandang AS selama lima putuh tahun terakhir. Masa depan dunia internasional tampaknya semakin ditentukan oleh langkah-langkah trump menjelang pemilihan presiden yang kedua kalinya pada 2020 mendatang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(A.S): Terima kasih atas kebersediaannya menjawab pertanyaan dari saya.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><br />\r\n<strong>RESENSI BUKU &ldquo;POLITIK GLOBAL AMERIKA DARI OBAMA KE TRUMP&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPemberi Resensi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Anna Safira<br />\r\nEditor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Randhi Satria</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Buku &ldquo;Politik Global Amerika dari Obama ke Trump&rdquo; karya Prof. Dr. Bambang Cipto, MA memberikan pemahaman kepada saya bagaimana politik luar negeri atau politik global Amerika dari masa ke masa, utamanya dari pemerintahan Obama ke pemerintahan Trump berjalan. Politik luar negeri Amerika dalam buku ini dijelaskan ke dalam beberapa bagian, yaitu politik luar negeri Obama dan Trump terhadap Eropa, Rusia, Asia, dan Timur Tengah. Buku ini juga dijelaskan berbagai peristiwa-peristiwa penting di belahan bumi lain dan bagaimana Amerika menyikapinya sesuai dengan kepemerintahan presidennya. Sebagai pembaca, saya merasa mudah memahami isi dari buku ini karena dijelaskan secara runtut dan rinci politik di Amerika dari sebelum pemerintahan Obama, sehingga saya dapat mengerti perbedaan dan perbandingan politiknya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/VhAC-AEbDzzDQrcV.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image:</em> Anna Safira.

Salah satunya karena perbedaan pandangan dan tujuan politik keduanya.

Jadi memang sudah saatnya bahwa kita kembali memprioritaskan laut sebagai fondasi kebijakan-kebijakan kita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(hi.id): Apa hal mendasar yang dibutuhkan Indonesia untuk maju sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(Y.S): Paling utama adalah komitmen: walaupun seperti saya jawab sebelumnya, yakni idealnya PMD digunakan untuk menjawab masalah bangsa kita, pada kenyataannya, pelaksanaan PMD sendiri belum banyak terjadi. Program-program PMD pemerintah masih lebih berupa kejanjutan dari proram-program lama, Cuma kali ini memakai jargon &ldquo;maritim dunia.&rdquo; Tidak ada pemikiran baru, yang mendobrak <em>status quo</em>.

Sebelum kita masuk ke strategi, pertama-tama yang kita butuhkan terlebih dahulu adalah apakah ada <em>political commitment</em> dahulu untuk mendorong konsep Poros Maritim Dunia. Tanpa adanya <em>political commitment</em>, kita tak perlu mendiskusikan strategi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nJika sudah memiliki komitmen secara politik, maka pertama-tama perlu adanya penyusunan <em>grand strategy</em> yang berdasarkan PMD ini, yakni bagaimana kebijakan seluruh birokrasi Indonesia diorientasikan ke aspek maritim, yang kemudian menjadi kebijakan maritim. Jadi ini bukan Cuma <em>rebranding</em> atau ganti nama saja, tapi juga bagaimana birokrasi kita benar-benar memfokuskan kebijakan mereka terhadap pembuatan kebijakan yang betul-betul mengenai maritim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(hi.id):&nbsp; Pada salah satu bagian di dalam buku ini anda menjelaskan tentang peran penting ekonomi dan militer untuk mendukung agenda Poros Maritim Dunia.

Mana yang anda yakini lebih berpengaruh?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(Y.S): Keduanya sama berpengaruh. Perekonomian kuat membuat Indonesia memiliki potensi ekonomi yang digunakan untuk mendorong kebijakan luar negerinya, sama seperti yang dilakukan Singapura saat ini &ndash; bagaimana kebijakan negara yang ukurannya kecil seperti itu bisa sangat berpengaruh di Asia Tenggara dan bahkan dunia. Sementara, militer yang kuat pada dasarnya memberikan taring dan kredibilitas untuk kebijakan luar negeri kita, yakni Indonesia diperhitungkan karena kita memang sebuah negara kuat yang berpengaruh secara militer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(hi.id): Beberapa negara lain seperti Jepang dan China juga memiliki sejarah panjang terkait maritime. Apa pelajaran yang dapat diambil Indonesia dari dua negara ini?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(Y.S): Kita mendiskusikan secara sekilas di buku kita bagaimana kita bisa belajar dari kebijakan pembangunan ekonomi kedua negara Jepang dan China. Kita sayangnya kurang membahas aspek maritim kebijakan mereka. Namun kalau boleh saya tambahkan, yang diperlukan adalah komitmen: China dulu mengirimkan armada raksasa Zheng Ho pada jaman dinasti Ming yang sempat sampai ke Afrika Timur. Namun ekspedisi Zheng Ho berakhir karena banyaknya tekanan dari dalam negeri China sendiri, terutama dari kalangan birokrat yang tidak mengerti apa fungsinya armada seperti itu &ndash; dan pandangan tersebut dapat dimengerti karena China pada dasarnya adalah kekuatan kontinental, walau dampaknya cukup signifikan kepada sejarah dunia, yakni yang menjadi penguasa lautan dunia adalah orang-orang Eropa. Namun kita bisa bertanya-tanya, bagaimana kalau waktu itu China terus mendorong ekspedisi-ekspedisi laut tersebut. Mungkin sekarang ini seluruh dunia berbahasa China, bukan Inggris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nUntuk Jepang, pelajaran yang sama pun bisa kita tarik. Waktu kita bilang &ldquo;Reformasi Meiji,&rdquo; kita biasanya berpikir bahwa waktu itu Kaisar hanya bertitah, lalu semua setuju. Tidak juga. Waktu itu terjadi perang saudara di Jepang, antara yang mendukung Kaisar melawan yang mendukung status quo waktu itu. Namun setelah pendukung Kaisar Meiji menang, mereka pun memiliki komitmen untuk belajar dari negara-negara Barat, dan memodernisasi, merombak tatanan feudal yang ada, dan belajar ilmu-ilmu perang Eropa. Akhirnya, mereka pun bisa mengalahkan China, dan kemudian bahkan Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/EB9m2LlfLVcVAWe_.jpg\" style=\"height:178px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image:</em> Bedah buku &quot;<em>Indonesia Inc.

Peta Jalan Menuju Poros Maritim Dunia&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><br />\r\nPemberi Resensi: Lukman Fahmi Djarwono<br />\r\nEditor: Randhi Satria</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPenulis mengawalinya dengan memperkenalkan secara singkat dan menyamakan definisi &ldquo;Poros&rdquo;, dengan berusaha membawa pembaca untuk mulai bersama-sama menyelami visi Indonesia pada masa kepemimpinan Presiden Joko Widodo. Penulis menganggap bahwa visi Indonesia sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia adalah menjadi simbolisasi romantika kejayaan maritim Kerajaan Sriwijaya dan Majapahit, serta buah responsif dinamika perkembangan lingkungan strategis dunia. Sebagai visi geopolitik dan manifestasi tujuan nasional, Poros Maritim Dunia bukanlah sesuatu yang baru. Seperti halnya India (1991), Amerika Serikat (era Presiden Obama), China (2017), dan Amerika Serikat (era Presiden Trump), konsep ini diyakini penulis memiliki kesamaan dalam melihat atau mawas ke luar (<em>outward looking</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Penulis menawarkan alternatif solusi geostrategi yakni &ldquo;Indonesia Inc.&rdquo; dengan belajar dari beberapa negara di Asia Timur seperti Jepang, Korea Selatan, China, dan Taiwan. Keempat negara ini dianggap sebagai negara industri maju dan <em>global trading power house</em> yang memiliki posisi unik, berada dalam satu sub-wilayah yang saling mengancam dan terancam, namun mereka mampu berperan signifikan dalam pereknomian global. Elemen visi nasional, tujuan nasional, serta strategi nasional dijadikan sebagai elemen dasar yang harus ditetapkan kembali sebagai acuan program pembangunan nasional Indonesia untuk menjalankan konsepsi Indonesia Inc. tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/GViPZXO2hk0Yjg73.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image:</em> Lukman Fahmi Djarwono, Pemberi Resensi</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Menurut saya kekuatan buku ini adalah kita diperkenalkan pada konsepsi <em>nation incorporated</em> <em>a la </em>Indonesia yang dapat digunakan sebagai geostrategi dalam mewujudkan visi Poros Maritim Dunia. Terinspirasi dari beberapa negara Asia Timur yang sudah menerapkan konsep ini, selanjutnya penulis memaparkan <em>roadmap</em> mulai dari penetapan kembali visi, tujuan, dan strategi nasional; bagaimana kita harus mengoptimalkan cara pandang dalam lingkup nasional, regional, dan global melalui wawasan nusantara; penyusunan kepentingan nasional oleh kepemimpinan yang visioner; hingga geostrategi Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Meskipun konsep <em>nation incorporated</em> ini tidak sepenuhnya baru, tapi setidaknya buku ini dapat menawarkan pilihan solusi konsep geostrategi untuk Indonesia. Potensi dan posisi strategis kelautan Indonesia yang belum dapat dioptimalkan selama ini, dapat menjadi keunggulan tersendiri yang tidak dimiliki negara lain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Bagi saya, buku ini pun tak luput dari celah, ada beberapa kekurangan dalam buku ini seperti saat mengawali pembahasan, pembaca &lsquo;dipaksa&rsquo; mengiyakan bahwa menjadi Poros Maritim Dunia adalah konsep terbaik bagi Indonesia di era Jokowi dalam menghadapi dinamika perkembangan geopolitik dunia. Belum adanya pembanding kritis bagi konsep Poros Maritim Dunia menjadikan pembaca dibuat terlena dalam suguhan <em>roadmap</em> yang disajikan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Kekurangan buku ini selanjutnya yakni kala penulis menyatakan bahwa dalam strategi pembangunan <em>hardpower</em>, Indonesia seharusnya menjalin kerjasama internasional di bidang pertahanan untuk membangun confidence building measures, khususnya kerjasama dengan negara-negara Asia Tenggara, sub-kawasan Oseania, serta Amerika Serikat dan China tentunya. Penulis menganggap dua negara terakhir tadi merupakan aktor vital dalam kemajuan teknologi pertahanan. Menilik pertimbangan faktor posisi dan peran strategis Indonesia sebelumnya yang pada akhirnya menjadikan diri Indonesia sebagai Poros Martim Dunia, seharusnya Indonesia sudah mulai berani untuk melihat (mawas ke luar) secara lebih luas lagi diluar dua negara tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Akhir kata, saya tetap meyakini bahwa buku ini memang perlu untuk dibaca oleh siapapun, baik dari kalangan akademisi ilmu sosial maupun ilmu eksak, birokrat, maupun masyarakat umum. Visi Poros Maritim Dunia tidak akan pernah terlaksana jika kita tidak segera memulainya, kita tidak akan dapat memulainya jika kita tidak mengenal apa itu Poros Maritim Dunia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">Surakarta,<br />\r\n16 Maret 2019</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><br />\r\nPeresensi<br />\r\nLukman Fahmi Djarwono<br />\r\n(Dosen Hubungan Internasional Fakultas Ilmu Sosial dan Ilmu Politik Universitas Sebelas Maret Surakarta)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Wawancara dan Resensi Buku Indonesia Inc.

(22,23,1,'Pentingnya Warga Negara Bagi Sebuah Negara','',NULL,'<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Penulis: Samuel Teofano Bago (Mahasiswa Hubungan Internasional Universitas Sebelas Maret)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Editor: Randhi Satria</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<strong>Pendahuluan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nKetika membahas hal apa pun yang berkaitan dengan Hubungan Internasional, pasti tidak akan luput dengan yang namanya &ldquo;negara&rdquo;. Ya, negara bisa dibilang merupakan inti dari ilmu Hubungan Internasional. Oleh karena itu, untuk mulai memahami Ilmu Hubungan Internasional, maka kita harus terlebih dahulu memiliki pemahaman mendasar tentang negara. Salah satu hal yang paling penting bagi sebuah negara agar bisa terbentuk adalah warga negara. Tanpa warga negara, tidak mungkin ada negara. Kenapa warga negara itu sangat penting sehingga ada atau tidaknya sebuah negara ditentukan oleh keberadaan warga negaranya? Secara sederhana akan dijelaskan sebagai berikut:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/F4lVkDaHmtPf8CKJ.jpg\" style=\"height:181px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>: <a href=\"https://scvrd.net/events-page/public-servant-recognition-breakfast\">https://scvrd.net/events-page/public-servant-recognition-breakfast</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Dasar dari terbentuknya negara</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSeperti yang sudah disinggung sebelumnya, negara tidak mungkin ada tanpa adanya warga negara. Hal ini karena negara itu sendiri sebenarnya merupakan perkumpulan dari orang-orang. Mulai dari mendirikan sebuah negara, menjalankan pemerintahan, hingga melindungi negara dari ancaman luar, semua itu tentu saja dilakukan oleh orang-orang yang menjadi warga negara tersebut. Karena negara membutuhkan adanya pemerintahan, maka siapa yang akan menjadi pemerintah jika tidak ada warga negaranya? Negara juga membutuhkan pemasukan melalui berbagai kegiatan ekonomi seperti kegiatan ekspor/impor, bayar pajak, dan lain sebagainya yang semuanya itu dilakukan oleh warga negara. Simak video ilustrasinya di sini:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/g5vvY0goybk\" width=\"300\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5vvY0goybk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5vvY0goybk</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Bagaimana negara bisa mendapatkan pemasukan jika tidak ada warga negara yang menyumbang pemasukan tersebut? Selain itu, negara memerlukan militer untuk mempertahankan wilayahnya. Tentu saja yang menjadi militer itu adalah warga negaranya sendiri. Jika tidak ada warga negara, siapa yang akan mempertahankan wilayah tersebut dari ancaman luar? Oleh karena itu, keberadaan warga negara sangat penting bagi sebuah negara. Sehingga, jika sebuah negara sampai kekurangan atau kelebihan jumlah warga negara, maka dapat menimbulkan masalah. Berikut akan diberikan contoh negara yameng kekurangan dan kelebihan warga negara:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<strong>Kasus negara kekurangan warga negara: Rusia</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nRusia adalah negara dengan wilayah terluas di dunia. Namun, jumlah penduduk yang tinggal di Rusia hanya sekitar 143 juta orang, lebih sedikit dari penduduk pulau Jawa yakni sekitar 145 juta orang, meskipun wilayah pulau Jawa jauh lebih kecil dibandingkan Rusia. Selain itu, jumlah penduduk Rusia juga berkurang sekitar 700.000-800.000 setiap tahunnya. Diperkirakan pada tahun 2050 mendatang jika hal ini terus berlanjut maka jumlah penduduk Rusia akan berkurang 32 juta orang menjadi hanya 111 juta orang saja. Ada beberapa faktor yang menyebabkan hal ini, yaitu: a) Tingkat kelahiran yang rendah, kecanduan alkohol dan kesulitan ekonomi menyebabkan banyak wanita di Rusia akhirnya tidak tertarik untuk memiliki anak, b) Tingkat kematian yang tinggi yang disebabkan oleh maraknya kecanduan alkohol, c) Tingkat aborsi yang tinggi, di mana ada lebih banyak bayi yang di aborsi dari pada bayi yang lahir, dan d) Banyaknya orang Rusia yang pindah ke negara lain karena alasan ekonomi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSemakin sedikit jumlah warga negaranya, berarti semakin sedikit jumlah tenaga kerjanya dan itu artinya semakin sedikit uang yang bisa dihasilkan untuk menumbuhkan ekonomi. Selain itu, jumlah warga negara yang semakin sedikit berarti banyak wilayah Rusia yang sangat kekurangan penduduk sehingga sulit untuk mempertahankannya. Contohnya adalah Siberia, wilayah yang luas di dekat perbatasan dengan China namun penduduknya sangat sedikit. Dengan terus masuknya imigran China ke Siberia dapat menjadi potensi terhadap ancaman kedaulatan Rusia ke depannya. Saat ini, Rusia berusaha mengatasi kekurangan penduduk dengan mengajak warga negara Rusia untuk memiliki lebih banyak anak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<strong>Kasus negara kebanyakan warga negara: Bangladesh</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDibanding Rusia, wilayah Bangladesh 120 kali lebih kecil namun penduduknya lebuh banyak dari Rusia, sekitar 161 juta orang, dan jumlahnya terus bertambah. Kebalikan dari Rusia, Bangladesh justru berusaha untuk mengurangi jumlah penduduknya dengan program &ldquo;2 anak cukup&rdquo;. Terlalu banyak jumlah penduduk membuat banyak pengangguran, karena lapangan pekerjaan yang ada lebih sedikit dibanding jumlah tenaga kerja. Banyak pengangguran juga berarti kemiskinan akan sulit untuk diatasi dan hal ini menciptakan kondisi yang cocok bagi kejahatan karena banyak pengangguran akan beralih ke tindakan kejahatan untuk bertahan hidup. Selain itu, pemerintah juga akan kesulitan mengatur masalah tempat tinggal bagi banyak warga negaranya dengan wilayah yang kecil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/vnTFdHnAEBIWjM5_.jpg\" style=\"height:415px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>: <a href=\"https://planetearth5.com/2017/02/24/overpopulation-results-in-global-stress/\">https://planetearth5.com/2017/02/24/overpopulation-results-in-global-stress/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<strong>Kesimpulan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nWarga negara merupakan bagian terpenting bagi negara. Namun, jumlah warga negaranya juga harus diimbangi dengan kualitas SDM yang bagus serta luas wilayah yang memadai. Wilayah yang luas namun penduduk yang sedikit menjadi masalah karena jumlah orang untuk mempertahankan dan membangun wilayah itu tidak cukup. Sebaliknya, wilayah yang kecil dengan penduduk yang banyak juga akan menimbulkan masalah karena tempat tinggal dan lapangan pekerjaan yang tersedia tidak cukup sehingga menciptakan pemukiman kumuh, pengangguran, dan tingkat kejahatan yang cukup tinggi. Untuk itu, pemerintah perlu merencanakan dengan baik pengendalian penduduk agar jumlahnya seimbang, serta pemerataan penduduk agar tidak ada wilayah yang penduduknya terlalu banyak atau terlalu sedikit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Bahan bacaan:</strong><br />\r\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . &ldquo;&lsquo;Chinese question&rsquo; looks far more threatening in Siberia than in Moscow&rdquo;.

Uni Eropa merupakan sebuah produk hasil integrasi di wilayah Eropa Barat. Integrasi yang terbentuk ini salah satunya disebabkan oleh ketakutan akan timbulnya perang baru dan keadaan ekonomi di Eropa pasca perang. Melalui buku ini Penulis Dr. Ali Muhammad mencoba menjelaskan berbagai keunikan Uni Eropa yang berbeda dari organisasi internasional lainnya yaitu memiliki karakter <em>intergovermentalisme</em> dan <em>supranasionalisme</em> dengan mempercayakan sebagian kewenangan Negara mereka kepada badan &ndash; badan pembuat kebijakan Uni Eropa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/gSlfM53i_FfjWF_s.jpg\" style=\"height:433px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>: Buku Supranasionalisme Uni Eropa karya Dr. Ali Muhammad</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDalam buku ini saya menemukan berbagai macam hal menarik yang penulis coba sampaikan. Pertama, adalah tentang mekanisme keanggotaan dan perluasan keanggotaan dalam Uni Eropa yang memiliki dua aliran utama pendukung yaitu deepening merupakan pendalaman internal kualitas organisasi dan widening merupakan perluasan keanggotaan dengan syarat yang lebih longgar. Selain itu gelombang perluasan yang dilakukan secara bertahap tetap mengalami berbagai kendala utama salah satunya ketimpangan ekonomi dan demokrasi serta budaya politik negara yang berbeda. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nKedua, adalah terkait kebijakan ekonomi sebagai kekuatan besar Uni Eropa yaitu integrasi ekonomi. Hal tersebut dapat dilihat dari penyelesaian proyek pasar tunggal yang dilakukan dengan menghapus berbagai macam hambatan seperti fisik, fiskal, hingga teknis disamping berbagi implikasi yang ditimbulkan dalam berbagai sektor. Salah satu bentuk kesuksesan besar pasar tunggal adalah penerapan zona euro di kawasan tersebut. Penerapan mata uang tunggal euro dianggap sebagai pencapaian puncak lima puluh tahun Uni Eropa dan berperan menjadi aktor baru yang penting dalam sistem ekonomi internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nKetiga, adalah masalah kompleksitas hubungan Uni Eropa dengan aktor lainnya. Dalam buku tersebut menjelaskan tentang hubungan tarik ulur transatlantik dengan Amerika Serikat karena seringkali terdapat perbedaan pandangan. Kemudian juga menjelaskan tentang ketidakharmonisan hubungan Uni Eropa dengan Russia yang semakin memanas setiap tahunnya. Selain itu juga menjelaskan tentang meningkatnya minat hubungan Uni Eropa dengan organisasi regional lainnya yaitu ASEAN yang ditandai dengan munculnya berbagai dialog dan pendekatan bilateral dengan Negara &ndash; Negara di asia tenggara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nHal terpenting lainnya yang saya dapat setelah membaca buku ini adalah bahwa Uni Eropa merupakan sebuah organisasi yang berjalan melewati berbagai fase penting dalam sejarah dunia seperti masa pasca perang dunia, perang dingin, krisis keuangan global, hingga berbagai masalah baru lainnya yang muncul. Hal tersebut telah membentuk Uni Eropa tumbuh dengan berbagai kebijakan dan aktivitas yang dipengaruhi oleh hal &ndash; hal tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/rWmM9hToSySsJEhN.png\" style=\"height:221px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>: Patricia Gita Pusparini.

Dalam buku tersebut saya melihat terdapat berbagai fakta menarik tentang topik pembahasan dan perspektif beberapa teori dalam hubungan internasional yang dapat digunakan untuk melihat aktivitas Uni Eropa. Dengan menggunakan pendekatan secara Historis penulis mencoba membuat para pembaca agar dapat lebih mudah memahami alasan hingga sebab akibat bagaimana serangkaian peristiwa yang menyangkut Uni Eropa terjadi. Berbagai macam hal dapat dieksplorasi lebih lanjut oleh setiap pembaca meskipun sering dijumpai kesalahan penulisan kata maupun kalimat. Menurut saya, buku ini cocok bagi setiap pembaca yang ingin menggali lebih dalam pengetahuan tentang Uni Eropa yang masih memiliki relevansi hingga saat ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">Surakarta, 30 April 2019<br />\r\nPemberi resensi,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><br />\r\nPatricia Gita Pusparini<br />\r\nMahasiswi Semester 4 Program Studi Hubungan Internasional Universitas Sebelas Maret Surakarta</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Resensi Buku Supranasionalisme Uni Eropa','Buku, Resensi, Supranasionalisme, Uni Eropa','042019',2,1,1543,NULL,1556600400,1556631193,1607087533,1,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,1550),
(24,24,1,'KONFERENSI ASIA – AFRIKA 1955: Asal Usul Intelektual dan Warisannya bagi Gerakan Global Antiimperialisme','',NULL,'<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Konfrensi Asia Afrika (KAA) tahun 1955 menjadi tonggak sejarah penting tidak hanya bagi Indonesia tetapi juga bagi negara-negara di dunia. KAA berhasil menunjukkan kepada dunia tentang semangat perjuangan anti imperialis yang selama ini dilakukan oleh negara-negara maju dari barat terhadap wilayah-wilayah di Asia maupun Afrika yang kala itu masih tertinggal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sebuah buku berjudul &ldquo;<em>KAA 1955 &ndash; Asal Usul Intelektual dan Warisannya Bagi Gerakan Global Antiimperialisme</em>&rdquo; mencoba mengangkat kembali romantisme tersebut kepada para pembaca. Buku ini juga mencoba menyajikan fakta sejarah tentang gagasan-gagasan intelektual yang ketika itu menginspirasi para pemikir bangsa. Buku ini ditulis oleh Wildan Sena Utama dan Tim HubunganIntenrasional.id tertarik untuk menelusuri lebih jauh tentang buku ini. Simak wawancara dan resensinya berikut ini!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>HubunganInternasional.id (HI.id): Apa yang latar belakang anda menulis buku &ldquo;KAA 1955 &ndash; Asal Usul Intelektual dan Warisannya Bagi Gerakan Global Antiimperialism?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Wildan Sena Utama (WSU): Asal usulnya ada dua alasan mengapa saya menulis buku ini. <em>Pertama</em>, ketertarikan saya pada studi sejarah transnasional aktivis antiimperial dan antikolonial Asia di masa abad ke-20 menemukan satu fenomena historis yang menarik bahwa jaringan yang ditempa oleh aktivis antiimperial/antikolonial Asia dan Afrika berujung pada satu momen poskolonial penting di pertengahan abad ke-20, yaitu Konferensi Asia-Afrika. Sukarno, Ali Sastroamidjojo, Roeslan Abdulgani, Moh. Hatta menyinggung mengenai pembangunan jaringan transnasional tersebut yang telah berakar sejak masa<em> interwar </em>dalam pidato dan tulisan-tulisannya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sebagai seorang sejarawan yang menemukan genealogi semacam ini ditambah ketidaktahuan betapa peristiwa ini begitu kompleks terkait dengan asal-usul munculnya Dunia Ketiga maka hal ini semakin menantang saya untuk melakukan penelitian terhadap KAA. Narasi global dibalik KAA ini penting diketahui oleh publik agar peristiwa ini diingat sebagai perjuangan panjang aktivis dan intelektual Asia dan Afrika (termasuk Indonesia sebagai salah satu penggeraknya) dalam membebaskan Dunia Ketiga dari kolonialisme dan rasisme yang belum berakhir, membangun hubungan antar benua yang lebih intim, sekaligus menghadapi tantangan ke depan dalam bentuk imperialisme Perang Dingin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Kedua</em>, ketika saya mulai riset tahun 2015, tahun ini adalah momentum yang sangat tepat dan semakin mendorong saya untuk menyelesaikan riset ini. Tahun itu bertepatan dengan peringatan 60 tahun KAA. Hal yang menarik bagi saya adalah masih banyak sekali sejarawan, ilmuwan hubungan internasional, ilmuwan sosial, sampai aktivis yang mengganggap peristiwa itu masih memiliki relevansi sampai saat ini. Atas dasar itu masih banyak kajian yang berusaha melakukan reinterpretasi ulang dan kontekstualisasi gagasan KAA (antikolonialisme, antiimperialisme, kedaulatan, hak asasi, dan perdamaian dunia) dengan problem-problem dan situasi yang dihadapi oleh dunia hari ini. Meskipun, dunia hari ini berubah dan problem politik dunia semakin kompleks, tapi Spirit Bandung masih dianggap sebagai penggerak yang diperhitungkan bagi orang-orang yang memimpikan dunia yang lebih adil dan bebas dari penindasan dan ketakutan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(HI.id): Menurut pendapat anda, apa yang menjadi alasan/kepentingan Indonesia mengadakan (KAA)?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(WSU): Hal ini berkaitan dengan konteks historis dan politis yang dialami dan diperjuangkan Indonesia &ndash; dan juga beberapa negara Asia lainnya &ndash; ketika itu. Menghadapi bahaya Perang Dingin yang mengancam kedaulatan nasional sekaligus kedaulatan regional di tahun 1950-an, Indonesia tidak bisa berdiam diri melihat itu karena ini bertentangan dengan prinsip politik bebas dan aktif yang mereka anut. Indonesia tergerak untuk membicarakan masalah Perang Dingin di Vietnam dan Asia dengan negara-negara Asia lainnya yang ketika itu sama-sama belum lama merdeka. Mereka ingin agar kedaulatan nasional mereka dihormati sekaligus ingin wilayah nasional, regional, maupun kontinental aman dari ancaman perang. Indonesia membaca situasi geopolitik waktu itu bahwa tantangan yang dihadapi bersama oleh Asia dan di masa depan adalah ancaman intervensi kekuatan besar Perang Dingin. Buktinya sudah jelas di Vietnam, Korea, dan Taiwan. Asia Tenggara begitu rentan posisinya dalam pertarungan dua kekuatan besar Perang Dingin. Hal ini begitu jelas dikatakan oleh Odd Arne Westad dalam The Global Cold War bahwa intervensi kekuatan adidaya paling panas terjadi di wilayah Dunia Ketiga &ndash; wilayah yang diabaikan dalam narasi historiografi Perang Dingin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Di samping menghadapi permasalahan intervensi Perang Dingin, dalam imajinasi para pemimpin nasionalis Indonesia, bahaya kolonialisme itu belum berakhir. Di Afrika, perjuangan antikolonialisme sedang menggelora. Hal ini bisa dilihat dari dukungan Indonesia terhadap perjuangan kemerdekaan negara-negara Afrika Utara. Masalah ini juga tercantum dalam komunike Konferensi Kolombo. Hal ini juga tidak dibiarkan oleh Indonesia dan merasa bahwa mereka memiliki tanggung jawab, karena secara historis mereka pernah berada dalam kolonialisme, untuk membicarakan masalah ini dengan negara-negara Asia dan Afrika.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/of9KngF6KCx8wKGK.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:207px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>:<em><strong>http://marjinkiri.com/product/konferensi-asia-afrika-1955-asal-usul-intelektual-dan-warisannya-bagi-gerakan-global-antiimperialisme/</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Untuk membicarakan dua problem besar yang dihadapi dunia ketika itu, ancaman Perang Dingin dan kolonialisme, Indonesia merasa bahwa suara-suara Asia dan Afrika perlu dipertemukan. Alasannya jelas dua benua ini menghadapi tantangan politik yang sama dan digerakkan olehnya. Selain itu, secara historis mereka memiliki sejarah yang hampir identik: pernah merasakan kolonialisme dan berjuang untuk pembebasan nasional. Ali Sastroamidjojo kemudian mengusulkan kepada inisiator Konferensi Kolombo untuk mengadakan semacam Konferensi Perdana Menteri yang lebih luas dengan melibatkan negara-negara Afrika dengan keyakinan bahwa baik negara Asia dan Afrika memiliki kesamaan historis dan tantangan politis yang sama. Ditambah lagi, tokoh-tokoh internasionalis, seperti Ali Sastroamidjojo, Sukarno, dan Hatta, memiliki keyakinan bahwa upaya tersebut mungkin dilakukan berdasarkan kenyataan bahwa pembangunan jaringan antiimperialisme Asia dan Afrika telah ditempa sejak awal abad ke-20. Mereka ingin mewujudkan cita-cita bersejarah itu: pertemuan negara-negara Asia dan Afrika yang kini merdeka dan hampir merdeka membicarakan problem-problem (dunia) yang mereka hadapi. Dahulu, mereka pernah bertemu di Eropa (Brussels, Berlin, London, dll) ketika kondisi mereka masih terjajah, sekarang mereka ingin membalikkan geopolitik sirkuit pertemuan itu di Dunia Ketiga (Bandung, Jakarta, New Delhi, Kairo, dll) sebab banyak negara Asia dan Afrika kini telah merdeka</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(HI.id): Keberhasilan Indonesia mengadakan KAA dianggap sebagai salah satu puncak keberhasilan diplomasi Indonesia di level intenrasional. Hal yang serupa rasanya sulit kita temui di masa kini. Menurut pendapat anda, elemen apa yang &ldquo;hilang&rdquo; dalam diplomasi Indonesia masa kini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(WSU): Mungkin beberapa hal di antaranya adalah kepekaan dan keberanian dalam merespons situasi ketidakdilan yang masih terjadi dalam politik internasional. Mungkin hal ini dipengaruhi oleh perbedaan alam sosial-politik-kebudayaan yang membentuk diplomat Indonesia hari ini dan masa lalu. Bila dahulu kebanyakan diplomat kawakan kita merupakan aktivis dan intelektual penggerak antikolonialisme yang ditempa dalam politik pergerakan melawan Belanda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Mereka tidak hanya aktif dalam berdiskusi, bertemu rakyat, berorganisasi, tapi memiliki kemampuan intelektual yang mumpuni, dibuktikan dari kemampuan berbahasa dan menulis yang bagus. Mereka bukan hanya intelektual: bersekolah di sekolah elit terbaik Eropa dan berkuliah di universitas terbaik di Eropa dan Indonesia, tetapi mereka intelektual-organik yang memiliki kesadaran untuk turun dari singasana kelasnya untuk menyadarkan, mengorganisasi, dan menggerakkan masyarakat untuk bergerak melawan pemerintah kolonial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Orang-orang ini, Moh. Hatta, Sjahrir, Agus Salim, Ali Sastroamidjojo, Sukarno, Abu Hanifah, ketika Indonesia merdeka mengisi peran dalam kebijakan-kebijakan politik luar negeri Indonesia. Diplomat-diplomat kita di masa lalu memang tidak memiliki pengetahuan pedagogik ilmu hubungan internasional yang didapat dari bangku universitas, tapi pengetahuan itu didapatkan langsung atau otodidak dari pembacaan yang dalam atas politik internasional dan pengalaman panjang politik nasional dan internasional yang mereka alami.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(HI.id): KAA telah menjadi warisan bagi dunia. Menurut pendapat anda, bagaimana Indonesia seharusnya memanfaatkan fakta sejarah ini dalam kepentingan nasionalnya di masa kini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(WSU): KAA seharusnya menjadi refleksi sesungguhnya Indonesia dibangun dan memperjuangkan cita-cita keadilan, kesetaraan, kemanusiaan, dan perdamaian dunia. Kepentingan nasional kita terus berubah seiring berjalannya waktu, tetapi nilai-nilai yang ditetapkan dan dicita-citakan dalam politik bebas dan aktif dan KAA &ndash; yang kurang lebih merupakan saripati dari <em>raison d&rsquo;etre</em> Indonesia &ndash; saya pikir masih relevan dan kontekstual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(HI.id): Apa saran yang ingin anda sampaikan kepada para pembaca khususnya terkait KAA?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(WSU): Meskipun KAA merupakan peristiwa penting dalam dunia pascakolonial, namun masih banyak dimensi dari KAA yang belum banyak dianalisis. Beberapa topik yang menarik di antaranya: bagaimana hubungan antara sejarah pemikiran mengenai Afro-Asianisme muncul dalam pikiran para tokoh-tokoh antikolonial/antiimperial Indonesia dengan asal-usul kemunculan KAA; apakah ada hubungan politik bebas dan aktif dalam kemunculan KAA; apa warisan KAA dalam bidang kebudayaan dan ekonomi &ndash; sebab wacana yang diperdebatkan KAA tidak hanya terkait dengan politik, tapi juga ekonomi dan kebudayaan; mengapa pasca KAA banyak sekali gerakan solidaritas transnasional yang muncul dari kalangan profesional-aktivis: mahasiswa, pengarang, buruh, wartawan, juris, sampai feminis; dan apakah <em>Bandung Spirit</em> masih relevan dalam gerakan-gerakan aktivisme masa kini dalam masalah lingkungan, gender, dan teknologi. Saya pikir untuk melihat apakah KAA merupakan <em>landmark</em> yang berpengaruh dan daya juangnya masih relevan dalam politik dunia, salah satu caranya adalah mengkajinya terus-menerus secara ilmiah dan tidak menempatkannya semata-mata secara romantic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/HMbxEdO32iQhhdN2.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:288px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>: Wildan Sena Utama.

Salah satu alasan mengapa KAA masih perlu dikaji hingga saat ini adalah studi sejarah transnasional mengenai jalinan politik antara Indonesia dengan dunia internasional. Dengan mengkaji KAA melalui perspektif sejarah, warga negara Indonesia ataupun masyarakat internasional dapat mengetahui bagaimana proses dan substansi tujuan KAA dibentuk. Pada tahun 1950-an, terdapat 29 negara di Asia dan Afrika yang baru merdeka mengadakan suatu pertemuan di Bandung, tepatnya pada tanggal 18 hingga 24 April 1955 di Bandung. Tujuan pertemuan tersebut adalah untuk membangun suara dalam membendung kolonialisme dan imperialisme Barat serta membentuk solidaritas di antara mereka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nAlasan negara-negara di kawasan Afrika dilibatkan dalam KAA selain kesadaran politik dalam memerangi kolonialisme dan membendung Perang Dingin juga karena adanya kesadaran historis, yakni adanya jaringan atau interaksi antara intelektual Asia Afrika. Tokoh-tokoh seperti Hatta yang masih menjadi aktivis Perhimpunan Indonesia atau Nehru yang menjadi punggawa <em>India National Congress</em> sebelum menjadi negarawan dan masih menjadi aktivis anti-kolonial mereka sudah membangun jaringan. Setelah terselenggaranya KAA, Bandung diibaratkan menjadi tempat yang istimewa bagi negara-negara di Afrika karena momentum di kota tersebut telah membuat mereka terbebas dari kolonialisme yang dilakukan oleh Barat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nBuku ini memberikan informasi pengetahuan mengenai sejarah terbentuknya KAA 1955 di Bandung dengan gaya bahasa yang menarik sehingga membuat para pembaca seolah-olah berada dalam situasi sejarah maupun hal yang sama. Selain itu, buku ini menyajikan sejarah KAA kronologis dan jelas serta memberikan data-data berupa cuplikan pidato serta dokumentasi berupa foto yang membuat pembaca menjadi tidak bosan ketika membaca lembar demi lembar. Buku ini mampu memberikan sudut pandang baru dari berbagai negara yang terlibat di KAA maupun konferensi lain sebelum dan sesudah terselenggaranya KAA. Pembaca juga akan semakin memahami bagaimana pentingnya KAA bagi negara di Asia Afrika. Gejolak-gejolak perpolitikan digambarkan dengan jelas salah satunya dapat dilihat ketika para delegasi KAA menyampaikan maksud maupun tujuan mereka dalam pidatonya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/0lpYsYxolZlyA9_P.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:169px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>: Nadia Dian Ardita. Persensi</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nBuku ini penting untuk menjadi salah satu referensi mengenai peran Indonesia dalam kancah internasional ketika kemelut Perang Dingin sedang terjadi. Kita dapat memahami makna-makna dari setiap tindakan yang dilakukan oleh para pemimpin dunia dalam mengambil keputusan ataupun sikap dalam menghadapi suatu persoalan internasional. Selain itu, buku ini akan mengajak kita merenungkan kembali mengenai makna dari penyelenggaraan peringatan-peringatan KAA yang memiliki kecenderungan hanya mengenang peristiwa KAA saja. Sebaiknya kita harus memahami mengenai nilai-nilai yang ada di KAA itu sendiri agar tidak memunculkan suatu romantisme dalam memandang KAA. Dapat dilihat bahwa hingga saat ini masih banyak negara-negara di Asia dan Afrika yang belum sepenuhnya merasakan &lsquo;kebebasan&rsquo; dari blok yang ada di dunia. Dengan demikian, buku ini mengajak kita untuk kembali menyalakan <em>Bandung Spirit</em> agar negara-negara di Asia-Afrika dapat bersaing dengan negara-negara maju serta menunjukkan eksistensi yang lebih di kancah internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">Surakarta, 18 Mei 2019</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">Nadia Dian Ardita<br />\r\n(Mahasiswi Hubungan Internasional Semester 6 Universitas Sebelas Maret Surakarta)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Wawancara dan Resensi Buku','Indonesia, Buku, Asia, Afrika, Antiimperialisme','052019',2,1,2031,NULL,1558155600,1558193767,1607055711,1,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,2045),

Saat ini, setiap pilar menunjukkan potensi yang besar berupa peluang bagi negara-negara anggota ASEAN, namun di saat yang sama juga memberikan ancaman tersendiri. Dalam buku ini, para penulis mencoba melihat berbagai potensi tantangan yang ada melalui celah ketiga pilar Masyarakat ASEAN, kemudian para penulis secara komprehensif dan sistematis membahas persoalan - persoalan tersebut dalam buku ini. Dalam pembahasan pada bab-bab awal, pembaca diajak untuk melihat tantangan yang akan dihadapi pada pilar politik-keamanan, seperti membangun budaya damai dalam kawasan ASEAN yang dirasa menjadi tantangan yang cukup besar bagi masyarakat ASEAN, oleh karena itu peningkatan kerjasama serta peran agama dirasa menjadi poin penting untuk membantu mengatasi tantangan ini. Selain itu, permasalahan keamanan juga fokus pada tantangan dalam memberantas kejahatan transnasional di wilayah tersebut. Sebagai contoh perdagangan narkoba, perdagangan manusia, dan terorisme masih menjadi ancaman yang sangat besar bagi masyarakat ASEAN, namun sayangnya blueprint keamanan yang dicanangkan oleh Masyarakat ASEAN masih belum terlaksana dengan baik, padahal kejahatan transnasional memiliki potensi untuk mengikis kepercayaan sentral hingga mempengaruhi kesejahteraan politik, ekonomi dan sosial di wilayah Asia Tenggara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Selain tantangan dalam pilar politik-keamanan, penulis juga mencoba untuk menunjukkan tantangan-tangan yang datang dalam pilar ekonomi, mulai dari pariwisata untuk meningkatkan perekonomian bagi negara-negara di kawasan ASEAN lewat adanya ASEAN Tourism Strategic Plan (ATSP)&nbsp; dengan tujuan untuk meningkatkan daya saing sektor pariwisata serta mempromosikan ASEAN sebagai Single Tourism Destination (ASTD). Tantangan dalam pilar ekonomi juga muncul melalui Masyarakat Ekonomi ASEAN (MEA) yang memberikan tantangan tersendiri bagi para arsitek serta pelaku Usaha Mikro Kecil Menengah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Dalam bidang sosial, penulis mencoba menunjukkan potensi dalam permasalahan identitas ASEAN serta permasalahan gender demi terwujudnya kesetaraan gender di wilayah Asia Tenggara. Kedua tantangan tersebut merupakan tantangan yang saat ini mendapat banyak sorotan. Pembentukan identitas ASEAN menghadapi cukup banyak tantangan baik itu dari dalam maupun luar ASEAN, seperti perbedaan politik, konflik sosial, kesenjangan ekonomi hingga hambatan dari negara-negara lain yang semakin mempersulit terbangunnya identitas ASEAN tersebut.

Pertama adalah passion saya, dalam aktivitas advokasi dalam waktu panjang untuk beragam isu seperti isu HAM, Gender, anti korupsi maupun pemilu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Kedua, masih terbatasnya buku buku bacaan HI untuk mahasiswa yang berbahasa Indonesia yang membahas non state actor dalam HI, isu advokasi transnasional maupun peran penting yang dimainkan aktor non negara dalam politik internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Alasan ketiga, adalah sebagai bagian bimbingan kepada mahasiswa&nbsp; S2 dan S1 HI UI untuk melatih mereka menulis dalam buku bacaan yang dipublikasikan secara luas dan dibaca oleh beragam kalangan tidak saja mahasiswa, tapi juga aktivis gerakan sosial, peneliti maupun pembaca umum yang berminat pada isu dan kajian hubungan internasional</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<em><strong>(HI.id): Tolong anda jelaskan kepada pembaca, apa itu transnasionalisme dalam Studi Hubungan Internasional?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(A.S): Transnasionalisme definisi sederhananya adalah aktivitas yang dilakukan lintas batas negara dimana salah satu aktornya bukan terdiri dari aktor negara. Definisi ini sangat longgar dan bisa dimaknai secara luas dalam HI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sebagai kajian akademik konsep transnasionalisme dalam HI bisa dimaknai beragam. Dalam definisi yang sangat luas transnasionalisme sering dimaknasi sebagai cosmopolitanisme dalam konteks globalisasi sehingga beragam isu transnasional seperti migrasi, refugee, diaspora, misalnya dikaitkan dengan kajian transnasionalisme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Dalam buku ini saya memaknai transnasionalisme dalam HI melalui jejak teori HI yang akarnya adalah konsep tentang International Society dari Hugo Grotius dalam bukunya <em>The Anarchical Society:&nbsp; A Study of world order in world politics</em> (1953).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/6k28OacNVqzUSdNE.jpg\" style=\"height:388px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>: Ani Soetjipto</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">International society sebagai struktur politik internasional; &ldquo;kumpulan negara yang bekerja sama dalam institusi internasional dan diatur oleh hukum internasional, perangkat diplomasi dan kebiasaan yang berjalan dalam relasi antar mereka (hal 26)&rdquo;. Kerja sama internasional antar negara yan diikat oleh serangkaian aturan dan insitusi yang mereka bentuk atas dasar kesepakatan diantara mereka. <em>Rules</em> and morality adalah faktor yang pedoman mereka berperilaku.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tonggak kedua: Linklater (1997) dalam bukunya Transformation of Political Community merevisi konsep awal tentang International society. Globalisasi menjadikan masyarakat bergerak melintasi batas negara dan merubah komunitas politik internasional sehingga diperlukan upaya memperluas batas dimana warga negara bisa bersatu secara politis dengan orang asing di luar negara mereka untuk memperjuangkan hak kewargaan global yang bebas dari penindasan / pengucilan.&nbsp; Konsep global citizenship- kewarganegaraan global adalah sumbangan Andrew Linklater dalam buku Transformation of Political Community ini. Struktur politik internasional yang disebutnya sebagai political community dicirikan dengan peran serta citizen (warga) yang berinteraksi secara global dengan state, market, institusi internasional maupun international norms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tonggak ketiga: Barry Buzan merevisi gagasan international society Bull dengan istilah cosmopolitanism (1999). Cosmopolitanism adalah pintu masuk dari penjelasan struktur internasional dimana TAN dan TNActivities dan transnational coalition yang dimotori oleh aktor non negara bisa ikut mewarnai dan menjadi subjek penting dalam politik international.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Bagaimana contoh keberhasilan aktor non-negara dalam mempengaruhi keputusan-keputusan penting yang diambil dalam interaksi Hubungan Internasional?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(A.S): Contohnya banyak. Bisa bentuknya norms entrepreur (memperkenalkan norma baru) mensosialisasikan norma tersebut dan menjadikannya norma global (misalnya norma tentang anti diskriminasi rasial, norma kesetaraan keadilan gender, norma anti-apartheid dst)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sumbangan yang lain gerakan gerakan advokasi transnasional bisa juga berhasil menghukum negara yang melanggar HAM misalnya kasus <em>East Timor Action Network</em> (ETAN) yang bisa mempressure Indonesia untuk menyetujui gagasan referendum untuk Timor Timur yang kemudian berujung pada kemerdekaan Timor leste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(HI.id): Menurut pendapat anda, apa hal yang mempengaruhi keberhasilan tersebut?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(A.S): Keberhasilan atau kegagalan suatu advokasi internasional ditentukan banyak faktor seperti <em>framing issues</em>, kekuatan jejaring (daya tahan &ndash; <em>endurance</em>, kekuatan mobilisasi, kekuatan finansial) serta ada atau tidaknya momentum politik untuk mendesakkan perubahan tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(HI.id): Bagaimana contoh kegagalan aktor non-negara dalam mempengaruhi keputusan-keputusan penting yang diambil dalam interaksi Hubungan Internasional?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n(A.S): Kegagalan dari advokasi Internasional kita bisa mencatat misalnya kegagalan advokasi untuk <em>Free Tibet Independence</em> dalam menekan Tiongkok, Kegagalan (belum berhasilnya) gerakan advokasi untuk LGBT untuk hak kaum LGBT dst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(HI.id): Menurut pendapat anda, apa hal yang mempengaruhi kegagalan tersebut?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(A.S): Kegagalan <em>Free Tibet Independence</em> adalah salah satunya karena karakter Tiongkok sebagai negara yang dianggap tidak demokratik. Semakin demokratik suatu negara peluang untuk melakukan perubahan dan tekanan lebih besar (menurut teori, tapi juga tergantung konteks politik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Kegagalan kampanye LGBT lebih banyak disebabkan karena momentum politik tidak mendukung bagi gerakan gerakan ini sampai saat ini</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>(HI.id): Apakah anda berkenan apabila dihubungi oleh pembaca untuk membahas lebih lanjut perihal buku ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">(A.S): Bisa, alamat email: ani_soetjipto@yahoo.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><em>(HI.id): Terima kasih atas kebersediaannya menjawab pertanyaan dari kami.

Melalui narasi kasus sosial yang berlangsung di Indonesia dan beberapa negara, buku ini seperti ingin mengajak kita bahwa &ldquo;hubungan internasional&rdquo; tidak lagi soal relasi-relasi formalistik, konsensus-konsensus melalui serangkaian pertemuan rutin, aksi-reaksi suatu negara dalam merespon tindakan negara lainnya. Hubungan internasional adalah tentang reklamasi Bali&nbsp; demi melayani turisme (hal.77), tentang polusi air (hal.165), tentang proteksi hewan (hal.139), tentang resistensi petani (hal 195) juga tentang kapasitas teknologi dalam proses revolusi di Mesir (hal 215). Lewat kasus-kasus yang diangkatnya, buku ini seperti ingin menegaskan bahwa hirarkhi antara &ldquo;problem nasional&rdquo; dan &ldquo;problem internasional&rdquo; sudah mengalami kekaburan (<em>blured</em>) sehingga membutuhkan cara pandang baru yang keluar dari cara pandang lama dalam menganalisis fenomena hubungan internasional yang semakin kompleks. Dengan cara itu, buku ini mencoba &ldquo;membawa isu domestik ke dalam isu global&rdquo; dan sebaliknya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Kehadiran buku ini menegaskan munculnya upaya sejumlah ilmuwan hubungan internasional yang mencoba menawarkan pandangan-pandangan alternatif. Disamping karena tatanan dunia sudah mengalami perubahan radikal, munculnya aktor-aktor baru di luar negara, semakin memberi pengaruh luar biasa dalam konstruksi tananan global kontemporer.&nbsp; Bagi Mark J Lacy (2014), pandangan kaum realis tentang isu-isu non-tradisional seperti bencana, lingkungan, perubahan iklim, hampir mendekati titik tragis.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; Bahkan bagi para pemikir di jalur Teori Kritis Coxian,&nbsp; istilah&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>world order</em>&rdquo; lebih relevan digunakan&nbsp; ketimbang istilah &ldquo;international relations&rdquo; (Cox, 1987). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Kehadiran NGO lingkungan transnasional seperti Greenpeace dan WWF dianggap James Paul memberi contoh kuatnya legitimasi kalangan ini dalam menangani suatu isu. Dalam sebuah poling di Jerman,&nbsp; publik lebih mempercayai suara NGO ini dibanding suara pemerintah Federal.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; Davies (2013) bahkan menyebut NGO sebagai suporpower baru dalam politik internasional mengingat jumlah dan kapasitas yang mereka miliki. Tak kurang dari 20.000 NGO beroperasi di seluruh dunia. Beberapa NGO internasional seperti <em>World Vision</em> bahkan memberikan bantuan yang melebihi jumlah bantuan luar negeri yang diberikan negara-negara besar seperti Italia dan Australia<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; NGO lingkungan internaional&nbsp; memiliki power yang cukup kuat dalam mendesain isu-isu lingkungan global terutama setelah Konferensi Bumi di Rio de Janiero (1992) dimana lebih dari 8000 NGO hadir dan 1400 NGO menjadi observer. Meskipun tidak mendeklarasi memiliki kekuatan politik, tetapi bagi Doyle dan McEahern, NGO (lingkungan) adalah organisasi politik.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; Dengan kapasitas dan jangkauan jaringan yang mereka miliki, NGO lingkungan internasional seperti WWF, Conservation International dan The Nature Conservancy dikelompokkan oleh Doyle dan McEarhern sebagai <em>global green governance</em> NGOs.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Dalam arus transnasionalisme, kehadiran global NGO melengkapi dua generasi transnasionalisme sebelumnya: transnasionalisme negara (<em>state transnasionalism</em>) dan transnasionalisme pasar (<em>market transnasionalism</em>). Kedua bentuk transnasionalisme tersebut telah memicu dunia pada tatanan global baru, sekaligus juga sebuah tragedi baru. <em>State transnasionalism</em> melahirkan kolonialisme bangsa yang kuat atas bangsa yang lemah, <em>market transnasionalism</em> melahirkan eksploitasi oleh pelaku-pelaku ekonomi raksasa dunia. <em>State transnasionalism</em> menempatkan globalisasi sebagai ajang akumulasi kekuasaan (<em>power accumulation</em>), sedang <em>market transnasionalism</em> menjadikan globalisasi sebagai panggung akumulasi keuntungan (<em>profit accumulation</em>). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDalam dua lanskap transnasionalisme ini, kehadiran aktor NGO diasumsikan akan mengajukan semacam interupsi untuk memberi aspek value. Bagi kalangan realis, aspek <em>value</em> mungkin dianggap terlalu &ldquo;suci&rdquo;, kurang jelas dan abstrak&nbsp; dalam menganalisis fenomena globalisasi yang didominasi aspek power dan profit. Tetapi bagi kalangan pasca-realis, signifikansi aktor-aktor non negara seperti NGO dalam peta hubungan internasional kontemporer tidaklah bisa diabaikan. Dalam pengantar buku ini, secara gamblang dipetakan posisi aktor non-negara dalam perdebatan dan kajian hubungan internasional kontemporer (lihat hal. 21-30). Bagi pengkaji transnasionalisme gelombang ketiga, hubungan internasional terlalu kompleks untuk hanya dilihat dari kacamata kaum realis yang hanya mendasarkan diri pada aspek-aspek material. Hubungan internasional, adalah juga tentang kontestasi gagasan, pengarusutamaan (<em>mainstreaming</em>) norma serta tentang pentingnya kekuatan ide. Hubungan internasional tidak melulu hanya dideterminasi oleh peran serta negara dan kekuatan ekonomi raksasa, tetapi juga muncul dari kekuatan-kekuatan yang dulu dianggap entitas klendesten dalam hubungan internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Bagaimana NGO sebaiknya ditempatkan? Sejak tahun 1980-an, kajian tentang NGO mulai menjadi kajian tak terpisakan dari kajian tentang civil society (Paul, 2000) karena pengaruhnya yang sangat kuat dalam berbagai isu-isu publik. Timothy Doyle dan Doug McEachem membuat empat kategori relasi negara dan NGO yakni dalam pandangan pluralis, korporatis, otoritarian dan post-modernis<sup>7</sup> &nbsp; yang bisa digunakan untuk mempermudah pembacaan atas posisi NGO. Bagi kaum pluralis, NGO ditempatkan sebagai partner atau mitra pemerintah. Dalam logika kaum pluralis, posisi NGO dianggap merepresentasikan kelompok sosial yang memiliki hak untuk mengambil posisi politik seperti dalam rangka menjalankan fungsi artikulasi dan agregasi kepentingan. Dalam logika kalangan ini, NGO merupakan representasi dari munculnya kelompok sosial baru sebagai konsekuensi dari proses modernisasi politik dan ekonomi. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/wXzNgKD3GPKRv2SU.jpg\" style=\"height:169px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: Ade M Wirasenjaya</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sementara dalam pandangan kalangan korporatis, negara dan NGO hidup dalam arena yang sama. NGO merupakan proyeksi dari kekuasaan negara. Logika ini tak lepas dari gagasan korporatisme negara yang memandang kelompok-kelompok yang tumbuh di masyarakat harus ditertibkan dan disiplinkan sedemikian rupa. Pandangan ketiga, dari kalangan otoritarian, cenderung membangun eksklusi terhadap NGO. NGO dianggap sebagai arena yang terpisah dari negara. Sementara pandangan keempat datang dari pandangan kaum pluralis yang melihat NGO dan negara sebagai entitas yang saling mempengaruhi. Selain merepresentasikan masyarakat yang plural, kaum post-modernis melihat bahwa NGO memiliki kekuatan penting: dari sisi jaringan, kekuasaan dan juga pengetahuan. Pandangan ini juga melihat bahwa NGO mencerminkan masyarakat yang fleksibel: mereka bisa membangun <em>networks</em> ke luar, ke dalam bahkan bersama negara.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp; Pandangan postmodernis berangkat dari tesis bahwa kekuasaan itu plural. Dengan cara pandang ini, kalangan postmodernis menempatkan NGO sebagai entitas yang juga memiliki power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Dilihat dari kategorisasi tersebut, buku yang disunting Ani Soetjipto menawarkan cara pandang keempat ini. Pandangan post-modernis tentang NGO nampaknya lebih bisa digunakan untuk melihat munculnya pluralitas aktor seperti sekarang. Terlebih jika yang akan dilihat adalah jaringan NGO dan bukan kajian relasi NGO dan rejim di suatu negara. Transnasional NGO merupakan varian gerakan masyarakat sipil global (<em>global civil society</em>).&nbsp; Mary Khaldor, pemikir yang dianggap cukup penting dalam ide ini menyebut <em>global civil society</em> (GCS) sebagai versi postmodern dari gagasan <em>new social movements</em> yang pernah popular pada tahun 1970-an.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp; Tumbuhnya GCS dipicu oleh munculnya isu-isu non-tradisional dalam hubungan internasional seperti perubahan iklim, AIDS, bencana, dan juga isu-isu sosial yang lahir karena ekspansi korporasi.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">SIGNIFIKANSI BUKU INI</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nBuku ini memberi gambaran tentang makin perlunya studi HI mengembangkan analisis multi-disiplin. Bagi ilmuwan HI di Indonesia, rasanya kajian-kajian tentang gerakan advokasi dalam konteks studi HI masih amat jarang. Fenomena gerakan sosial saat ini tidak mungkin terlepas dari fenomena hubungan internasional. Sekurang-kurangnya dari sisi dampak yang dihasilkannya, globalisasi dipastikan akan menyentuh kehidupan sosial di lapis bawah. Sementara itu, Indonesia merupakan negara yang sejak lama menjadi target perluasan pasar dan perluasan kekuasaan. Dalam konteks inilah buku 273 halaman ini menjadi menarik. Sayangnya,&nbsp; kasus-kasus dan analisis yang disajikan buku ini masih didominasi cara pandang advokatif yang hanya menempatkan NGO atau gerakan masyarakat sipil sebagai entitas baru yang memberi pengaruh pada elevasi kasus maupun isu dengan pola kerja voluntaristik. Apakah, misalnya, NGO juga memiliki potensi untuk menjadi blok sosial baru, yang memiliki power dan &ndash; mengutip Robert Cox -- kapabilitas material yang mereka gunakan untuk melanggengkan eksistensi dan kekuasaan? Juga, misalnya, kemungkinan bagi tiga gugus kekuatan trans-nasionalisme &ndash; negara, pasar dan civil society &ndash; untuk saling mengembangkan <em>division of labor</em>, berbagi arena dan juga berbagi <em>border</em> untuk menjalankan cara produksi baru? Barangkali ini penting untuk didiskusikan lebih lanjut.***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Catatan Kaki</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">1.

Geopolitik merupakan representasi dari dua hal yakni <em>physical feature</em> dan <em>political behaviour</em>. Kebijakan geopolitik suatu negara datang dqri pemaknaan lokasi atau bentuk negaranya.&nbsp; Dalam kaidah geopolitik ada banyak bentuk negara salah satunya adalah <em>Costal state</em> dan <em>archipilago state</em>. Di Asia Tenggara kondisi geopilitik bervariasi. Kalau kita maknai geopolitik ini adalah wilayah laut maka kita menggunakan mahzab <em>blue school</em>. Hal yang harus diperhatikan&nbsp; dalam pemaknaan geopolitik adalah Postur, Kultur dan struktur. Mengukur juga variabel ini di Asia Tenggara dalam konteks postur maka ada beberapa negara yang merupakan negara kepulauan dan negara pantai. Konsekuensinya adalah perumusan kebijakan luar negeri. Memang benar hak dan kewajiban negara pulau dan negara pantai berbeda namun orientasinya dalam yakni mengelola laut, mengontrol laut dan menjaga laut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Di Asia Tenggara dalam variabel ini terjadi perbedaan makna konsekuensinya adalah konflik yang terjadi di Asia Tenggara sudah menua terkhusus wilayah laut. Konflik yang terjadi di antara sesama negara diwilayah Asia tenggara misalnya Indonesia Malaysia, Indonesia Singapura, dan beberapa konflik lain adalah tantangan geopolitik maritim di Asia Tenggara. Konsekuensi lainya adalah pemkanaan dalam postur sebagai negara kepualauan dan negara pantai menimbulkan juga konflik inter regional dimana melibatkan Tiongkok di wilayah Laut Tiongkok Selatan dengan negara- negara Asia Tenggara. Lebih lanjut, konflik yang melibatkan aktor di luar kawasan Asia Tenggara seperti AS dan Rusia. Asia Tenggara menjadi wilayah yang menarik untuk di perebutkan dan dikuasai. Satu pendapat dalam <em>blue school</em> adalah siapa yang menguasai Asia Pasifik kedepan maka akan menguasai dunia. Namun menarikanya bercerita tentang faktor kedua yakni kultur, karakter negara Asia Tenggara selalau mengutamakan logika harmonisasi dalam penyelesaian masalah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asia Tenggara yang secara kultur juga banyak didiami oleh orang-orang melayu, dimana orang melayu selalu menggunakan berkomunikasi dengan hati. Akibatnya setiap masalah di Asia Tenggara selalu menggunakan penedekatan komunikasi, negosiasi yang masuk dalam strategi <em>Diplomacy activities</em>. Selain itu dalam konteks struktur yang selalu bernuansa kebijakan negara-negara Asia Tenggara selalu menggunakan logika harmoniasi atau logika kesesuaian sehingga kebijakan yang lahir dari setiap negara terutama konflik geopolitik selalu diselesaikan baik konteks bilateral maupun regional. Namun saat ini ASEAN terlalu fokus penyelesaain konflik tersebut dalam forum-forum seperti ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) padahal Asia Tenggara yang kemudian dikatakan sebagai ASEAN memiliki Asean Institute of Peace and reconciliation (AIPR).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong>(HI.id): Menurut pendapat anda, bagaimana kondisi geopolitik di Asia Tenggara saat ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(LOMF): Menurut saya Indonesia adalah negara yang memiliki logika pengambilan kebijakan yang harmonis. Barangkali ini sudah menjadi amanat konstitusi terkusus UU/37/1999 tentang hubungan luar negeri yang menyebutkan politik luar negeri Indonesia ditempuh melalui diplomasi. Saya fikir sebagai negara dengan karakter friendship yang selalu mengutamakan diplomasi dan negosiasi Indonesia harus menjadi leader dan menejer dalam pengelolaan konflik wilayah maritim di Indonesia. Satu argumentasi saya adalah penyelesain melalalui konfrontasi militer sebenarnya menunjukan baik aktor yang merasa menang dan atau aktor yang kalah keduanya sama, yaitu sama-sama kalah. Oleh sebab itu, menurut saya logika Indonesia sudah tepat. Hal ini juga menjawab bagaimana karakter politik luar negeri Indonesia yang tidak konsisten dan cenderung pragmatis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Menurut saya hal itu sudah tepat karena&nbsp; Indonesia bukan negara super yang memiliki banyak uang, kuat dalam bidang politik internasional, digdaya dalam militer maka bebas aktif adalah yang tepat dalam kondisi ini. Artinya Indonesia selalu menjadi leader untuk mengambil keuntungan dari semua situasi. Karena yang berubah dalam hubungan internasional adalah situasi. Lebih detail, ada 4 hal yang mungkin berubah yaitu Revolusi peran negara, ancaman prevelensi perang antar negara, perubuahan lingkungan strategis serta peran teknologi informasi. Konsekuensi ini harus dimaknai oleh Indonesia menghadapi tantangan regional dengan metode diplomasi. Sehingga kita sebagai negara akan selalu bekerjasama dengan siappuan dan mengambil keuntungan dari siapapun. Hal ini memang tergolong licik tapi sebagai negara kita harus paham memaknai situasi. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maka menurut penulis untuk mengembalikan ASEAN sebagai organisasi yang ramah maka logika institusinya harus harmonisasi bukan logika konsekuensi. Artinya Indonesia memiliki peran penting dalam memaknai situasi geopolitik di Asia Tenggara oleh sebab itu pendekatan Partnership diplomasi adalah yang utama tentunya dengan menggunakan paradigma konstruktivisme. Sehingga, Indonesia tetap dikenal sebagai negara peace maker dan mediator ulung baik regional maupun internasional. Keberhasilan Indonesia dalam merespon tantangan regional yang terus berubah maka Indonesia harus menjaga kestabilan regional adalah citra positif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong>(HI.id): Menurut pendapat anda, bagaimana Indonesia harus merespon kondisi ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(LOMF): Dalam menyelesaikan masalah tantangan regional ada tiga hal yang harus dipahami yaitu level kolaborasi, tingkat kerumitan masalah dan kapasitas menyelesaikan masalah. Buzan mengatakan setiap negara harus memahami asal ancaman, nilai ancaman, yang bertanggung jawab atas ancaman, pola respon perubahan menyelesasiakan ancaman. Berangkat dari kata Buzan tersebut saya memaknainya adalah tantangan penyelesaian masalah geopolitik di Indonesia adalah tantangan internal dan eksternal.&nbsp; Tantangan internalnya misalnya anggaran, pertahanan dan keamananan dan kelembagaan. Contoh untk mengelola laut kita butuh uang banyak kalau di buku pak Bernard Limbong, 2015 kita butuh 7200 Triliun. Persoalannya adalah kita bukan hanya mengembangkan laut ada pembangunan lain. Lebih lanjut, konsekuensinya adalah pertahanan dan kemanan kita tidak mendapatkan porsi yang baik dengan luas wilayah dari Sabang sampai merauke jelas saja kita butuh uang banyak untuk merevitalisasi peralatan pertahanan dan keamanan. Memang benar Kemenhan mendaptkan porsi 126 T untuk anggaran terbaru naik dari 107 T anggaran sebelumnya. Namun apakah sudah cukup untuk membiayai wilayah kita?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/JwjfNcN_LClF_XIT.jpg\" style=\"height:168px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: La Ode Muhammad Fathun</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Penulis pernah melakukan riset bersama Balitbang Kemhan dan turun lansung di beberapa wilayah perbatasan, kami menemukan bahwa jangankan bertahan dari musuh, para penjaga saja setengah mati menjangkau wilayah operasi. Namun penulis sepakat apabila ASEAN sudah konsisten memahami lingkungan strategisnya maka pertahanan dan keamaanan bukan domain utama tapi persoalannya tantangan geopolitik bukan hanya lahir dari regional. Kita selesai di regional belum tentu internasional contoh logika Tiongkok memaknai laut adalah logika konsekuensi sehinggga selalu berfikir untuk rugi. Ancaman Tiongkok di beberapa sisi dan menarik konflik bersama negara besar lainya sehingga menuntut ASEAN harus memiliki pandangan yang sama atau regionalisme complex artinya menciptakan ketahanan regional. Ancaman regional terkait batas wilayah menurut saya&nbsp; tidak akan sampai pada logika konfrontasi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disisi lainya ancaman non tradisional justru semakin banyak trutama menyangkut keamanan manusia. Ancaman teesebut adalah narkoba, senjata ilegal, penyelundupan manusia, terorisme maritim, pembajakan. Logika negara dan logika para pengancam non tradisional ini berbeda karena mereka berfikir untung dan rugi sementara negara berfikir harmonisasi. Kita bisa lihat betapa masifnya narkoba, pencurian ikan ilegal padahal sudah banyak hukum yang mengaturnya. Akibatnya negara kewalahan seperti yang telah saya sampaikan di atas tentang empat poin perubahan dunia. Memahami ini maka memang harus mengkombinasikan tiga domain utama yakni <em>security</em>, <em>sovereignity</em> dan <em>prosperity</em>. Seandainya semua negara memiliki logika yang sama maka membangun militer bukan hal utama lagi ketika keamanan sudah menjadi project bersama dan kedaulatan adalah hal yang harus dihormati bersama sehingga poin dasar kitaadalah memajukan ekonomi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong>(HI.id): Menurut pendapat anda, siapkah Indonesia menghadapi ancaman tradisional dari negara-negara di Asia Tenggara?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(LOMF): Menurut saya mau tidak mau Indonesia harus siap karena perubahan lingkungan strategis selalu berubah. Namun harus digaris bawahi adalah pemaknaan ancaman itu. Saya sudah menjelaskanya di buku itu dengan analisis Copenhagen dan Canadian School. Intinya kesiapan itu harus dibarengi dengan strategi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ada tiga pendekatan dalam menghadapi ancaman tergantung kemampuan kita. <em>Pertama</em> adalah sea denial dimana kemampuan negara untuk melakukan penangkalan apabila terjadi ancaman atau konsep ini setara dengan deterens yakni memukul psikologis para pengancam. Namun strategi ini tidak selalu efektif karena tidak selalu pengancam memiliki mental yang lemah biasanya mereka sudah siap bertarung. <em>Kedua</em>, <em>sea control</em> konsep ini relevan dengan kemampuan negara dalam mengotrol atau mengendalikan laut. Aktivitasnya adalah melakukan tindakan serangan terhadap pengancam namun bukan untuk melumpuhkan keseluruhan. Lebih lanjut, <em>layer control strategy</em> dan <em>militery projection</em> pola ini adalah tindakan untuk menghancurkan agar si pengancam agar tidak mengulang aksinya. Namun semua strategi ini disesuiakan dengan kemampuan negara. Hal yang harus dipikirkan adalah jumlah personil, anggaran, peralatan militer, koordinasi, kualitas diplomasi, dan teknologi informasi</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong>(HI.id): Apa saran anda untuk pembaca/penstudi Hubungan Internasional?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(LOMF): Menurut saya para mahasiswa HI lemah dalam konteks teori sehingga beberapa karya yang telah saya baca dan review analisisnya lemah sebelum di revisi. Teori memang mata kuliah membosankan tapi mata kuliah ini adalah penentu bagus tidaknya analisis. Selain itu dalam konteks sifat mahasiswa sekarang lebih suka instan berbeda dengan penstudi HI sebelumnya. Untuk itu sebagai dosen kita juga harus lebih kreatif dalam memberikan pelajaran. Kita tidak harus menjadi Guru lagi tapi kita harus penjadi partner mereka. Ada tiga hal yang harus dimiliki dosen di era ini yakni imajinatif, kreatif dan friendship. Walaupun tetap dalam koridor saling menghargai. Anak-anak harus dilatih disiplin, kerjakeras, jujur, teliti dan tentunya bekal IT dan cara berkomunikasi. Tantangan era ini sangat banyak maka harus bisa berkompetisi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong>(HI.id): Apakah anda berkenan dihubungi jika ada yang ingin bertanya terkait buku ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(LOMF): Saya siap dihubungi 085255125544 Laodemuhammadfathun@upnvj.ac.id</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(HI.id): Terima kasih atas kebersediaannya menjawab pertanyaan dari kami</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(LOMF): Terima kasih kembali semoga bermanfaat</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Wawancara dan Resensi Buku Indonesia dan Keamanan Kontemporer di Asia Tenggara','Buku, Asia, Tenggara, Indonesia, Keamanan','062019',2,1,1555,NULL,1561870800,1561895189,1607058103,1,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,1565),

Perkataan tersebut merupakan respon terhadap kebijakan Uni Eropa (UE) yang dinilai merugikan industri kelapa sawit Indonesia. UE menilai industri kelapa sawit di Indonesia tidak memenuhi kriteria <em>Sustainable Development Goals</em> (SDG&rsquo;s) khususnya di bidang lingkungan. Luhut menilai bahwa UE lebih mementingkan nasib orang utan dibandingkan nasib rakyat Indonesia. Lantas apa yang sebenarnya terjadi sehingga ada gesekan Indonesia dan UE mengenai masalah industri kelapa sawit?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDalam rangka implementasi SDG&rsquo;s yang dicanangkan oleh Perserikatan Bangsa Bangsa (PBB), UE mengkaji ulang penggunaan minyak nabati di Eropa pada 2016. Kajian yang dilakukan UE menghasilkan kesimpulan bahwa industri minyak kelapa sawit memberikan dampak kepada lingkungan yang lebih buruk dibandingkan dengan komoditas sejenis seperti minyak kedelai, minyak bunga matahari, dan minyak lobak. Dampak kerusakan lingkungan menurut UE antara lain penggundulan hutan, hilangnya habitat keanekaragaman hewan dan tumbuhan, serta polusi udara, tanah, dan air. Selain dampak kepada lingkungan UE juga meninjau dampak sosial dan isu ekonomi pada industri minyak nabati, sehingga kajian tersebut mencakup semua aspek yang diperhatikan dalam SDG&rsquo;s pada industri minyak nabati.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nKajian UE tentang SDG&rsquo;s pada industri minyak nabati pada akhirnya menghasilkan kebijakan di mana UE akan menghilangkan minyak kelapa sawit mentah dari sumber energi terbarukan yaitu biofuel pada tahun 2030. Biofuel sendiri merupakan bentuk komitmen UE terhadap SDG&rsquo;s dengan menciptakan energi terbarukan, untuk itu UE berdalih bahwa mereka butuh memastikan bahan baku biofuel memenuhi kriteria dalam SDG&rsquo;s. Kebijakan UE tentu mendapat kritikan keras dari negara-negara penghasil minyak kelapa sawit dunia, salah satunya adalah Indonesia. Indonesia merupakan penghasil kelapa sawit terbesar di dunia, disusul oleh Malaysia, dan Kolombia di bawahnya. Maka Pemerintah Indonesia melakukan protes ketika kebijakan UE merugikan industri kelapa sawit, apalagi Benua Eropa merupakan tujuan ekspor kedua minyak kelapa sawit mentah Indonesia di mana India masih menjadi tujuan utama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/wDmVBCTXAIhrnlJ8.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>: <a href=\"http://www.sawit.or.id/sumbangan-sawit-pada-sustainable-development-goals-dunia/\">http://www.sawit.or.id/sumbangan-sawit-pada-sustainable-development-goals-dunia/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPemerintah Indonesia menyatakan tidak akan tinggal diam dalam merespon kebijakan UE. Pemerintah Indonesia menilai bahwa UE telah melakukan diskriminasi perdagangan untuk menguntungkan industri minyak nabati Eropa seperti minyak kedelai, minyak bunga matahari, dan minyak lobak. Tanah di Benua Eropa sendiri tidak memungkinkan untuk ditumbuhi tanaman kelapa sawit yang membutuhkan iklim tropis, maka secara ekonomi Eropa tidak akan dirugikan dengan hilangnya penggunaan minyak kelapa sawit mentah untuk biofuel, bahkan memberikan keuntungan untuk mendorong produksi industri minyak nabati regional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Direktur Eksekutif Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC) Mahendra Siregar (<a href=\"http://www.bpdp.or.id/id/sawit-berkelanjutan/dunia-butuh-kelapa-sawit/\">BPDP, 2018</a>) mengatakan bahwa UE berpotensi melanggar ketentuan Organisasi Perdagangan Dunia (WTO) karena kebijakan UE mengenai pengurangan minyak kelapa sawit hingga 0% dalam biofuel adalah hambatan perdagangan non-tarif dan merupakan diskriminasi. Indonesia sendiri juga bertekad untuk melaporkan UE ke WTO, namun hal tersebut membutuhkan waktu yang panjang setidaknya 1,5 tahun setelah pendaftaran gugatan di mana dalam kurun waktu tersebut Indonesia harus melalui negosiasi dengan UE hingga gugatan tersebut pada akhirnya menemui final akan tetap diajukan ke WTO atau dibatalkan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Selain itu, Pemerintah Indonesia melalui Menteri Koordinator Bidang Kemaritiman (<a href=\"http://www.cnbcindonesia.com/market/20190320193729-17-61940/sawit-dihadang-ri-ancam-boikot-produk-uni-eropa\">Pablo, 2019</a>) memberikan ancaman kepada UE berupa adanya kemungkinan pemboikotan produk UE di Indonesia seperti pengalihan pesawat Airbus yang diproduksi negara UE menjadi Boeing dari Amerika Serikat, sampai menghentikan impor bus dan truk dari Scania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nLangkah Pemerintah menggugat UE untuk melindungi industi kelapa sawit dalam negeri ternyata juga mendapat kritik dari sejumlah pihak, khususnya UE. Melalui Duta Besar UE untuk Indonesia, Vincent Guerend, (<a href=\"http://beritagar.id/artikel-amp/berita/uni-eropa-tak-bermaksud-melarang-minyak-sawit\">Roosyana, 2019</a>) UE tidak berniat untuk melarang minyak kelapa sawit, hanya saja UE mencoba untuk memperketat aturan terhadap bahan baku biofuel mereka sebagai energi terbarukan. Minyak kelapa sawit yang memenuhi sertifikasi tentu tidak akan mendapatkan pelarangan sebagai bahan baku biofuel di Eropa. Selain itu UE juga masih menerima minyak kelapa sawit untuk kepentingan lainnya sebagai bahan baku kebutuhan rumah tangga dan makanan, bahkan pajak yang dikenakan UE terhadap minyak kelapa sawit lebih rendah dibandingkan yang dikenakan India. Maka tidak benar apabila dikatakan UE melakukan diskriminasi terhadap produk minyak kelapa sawit dan merugikan produsen kelapa sawit seperti Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nRespon Indonesia terkait kebijakan UE ini juga perlu dipertanyakan. Seharusnya Pemerintah Indonesia berfokus untuk membenahi kualitas produk dan proses produksi dari minyak kelapa sawit. Respon Indonesia yang mengecam keras UE dalam masalah minyak kelapa sawit bisa dinilai sebagai bentuk tidak adanya komitmen Indonesia terhadap SDG&rsquo;s. Tentu saja hal tersebut selanjutnya bisa menjadi bumerang bagi politik Indonesia di dunia internasional yang akan mendapatkan sorotan terkait kerusakan lingkungan akibat produksi kelapa sawit apabila tidak segera melakukan perbaikan kebijakan terkait regulasi dan sistem produksi kelapa sawit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nProtes Pemerintah Indonesia terhadap kebijakan UE tidak hanya dianggap sebagai bentuk <em>in-commitment</em> Indonesia terhadap SDG&rsquo;s. Namun juga menggambarkan bahwa Pemerintah Indonesia tidak sepenuhnya mewakili suara rakyat Indonesia. Pasalnya memang ada masalah dalam industri minyak kelapa sawit di Indonesia, bahkan juga memberikan dampak negatif kepada sebagian masyarakat Indonesia. Belum lagi suara protes terhadap industri kelapa sawit juga terjadi di dalam negeri. Maka respon tersebut dianggap sebagai politik luar negeri Indonesia yang kurang mewakili suara rakyat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPemerintah Indonesia perlu untuk melihat dengan segala pertimbangan, tidak hanya berfokus pada kepentingan materi yang menguntungkan elit-elit politik dan pengusaha kelapa sawit. Argumen tersebut tentu bukan tanpa alasan, pasalnya dampak negatif terhadap lingkungan yang menjadi alasan tidak memenuhinya minyak kelapa sawit dalam kriteria bahan baku biofuel di Eropa merupakan akibat dari kurangnya usaha industri kelapa sawit di Indonesia dalam memperhatikan aspek lingkungan. Polusi udara yang menjadi dampak industri kelapa sawit merupakan akibat dari pembakaran hutan untuk pembukaan lahan sawit, dimana membakar hutan menjadi cara yang efektif dan murah dalam membuka lahan daripada menggunakan cara yang lebih ramah lingkungan. Dengan membakar hutan perusahaan sawit ditaksir mampu menghemat Rp 2 hingga 3 juta/ha (<a href=\"http://detik.com/news/berita/d-3025782/kementerian-lhk-hutan-dibakar-perusahaan-demi-hemat-biaya-buka-lahan-sawit\">Bilkis, 2015</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Polusi air dan tanah yang menjadi momok bagi warga sekitar lokasi produksi merupakan bentuk kurang seriusnya perusahaan sawit dalam pengelolaan limbah produksi. Tercemarnya sungai membuat ikan-ikan mati, selain itu air sungai yang diserap oleh tanah menjadikan lahan sekitarnya menjadi tidak subur. Maraknya pembunuhan terhadap satwa dilindungi seperti orang utan yang dianggap menjadi hama perkebunan sawit juga merupakan bentuk bahwa industri kelapa sawit di Indonesia masih sangat kurang memperhatikan SDG&rsquo;s di bidang lingkungan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Belum lagi adanya masalah persekusi lahan yang dilakukan perusahaan kepada penduduk sekitar. Pemerintah sebagai otoritas yang memiliki kewenangan memberikan izin tentu menjadi pihak yang seharusnya mampu menyelesaikan permasalahan ini dengan mengeluarkan sanksi yang tegas, namun pada kenyataannya hal ini telah terjadi dalam waktu yang lama dimana menandakan adanya pembiaran oleh pemerintah. Fakta mengejutkan juga terjadi ketika mantan Gubernur Riau, Annas Maamun, dan Ketua Asosiasi Petani Kelapa Sawit Provinsi Riau, Gulat Medali Emas Manurung terjerat kasus suap alih fungsi hutan dan pemberian izin industri kelapa sawit (<a href=\"http://amp.kompas.com/nasional/read/2019/04/29/22020201/2-tersangka-kasus-alih-fungsi-hutan-di-riau-dicegah-ke-luar-negeri\">Rachman, 2019</a>). Kasus tersebut menjadi fakta bahwa adanya persekongkolan elit politik dan elit perusahaan yang menjadi salah satu faktor terabaikannya SDG&rsquo;s industri kelapa sawit demi menekan ongkos produksi dan memperoleh keuntungan yang lebih besar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/QDFRVITIARe7ys5v.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Foto: Aditya Dwinda Pratama</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPolitik luar negeri suatu negara seharusnya bisa menjadi cerminan kondisi domestik negara tersebut dalam menyikapi sebuah persoalan. Dengan melihat kondisi domestik yang diwarnai aksi protes atas adanya dampak negatif industri kelapa sawit berupa kerusakan lingkungan dan beberapa kerugian yang diterima masyarakat, seharusnya perbaikan terhadap industri kelapa sawit menjadi fokus pemerintah sehingga bisa menyelesaikan masalah domestik serta bisa kembali bersaing dalam perdagangan bahan baku biofuel Eropa. Maka respon Pemerintah Indonesia yang mengecam dan bersikeras untuk menggugat UE dirasa kurang tepat dan objektif karena hanya berorientasi kepada profit perdagangan kelapa sawit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sebagai negara yang penuh dengan kekayaan alam, salah satunya berupa tanah yang cocok untuk perkebunan kelapa sawit, selain memanfaatkan, sepatutnya Indonesia juga menyadari untuk menjaga alam. Terlalu berorientasi terhadap materi akan membuat Indonesia mengabaikan aspek-aspek lainnya seperti lingkungan dan kesehatan. Rusaknya lingkungan dan terganggunya kesehatan tentu akan mengganggu kesejahteraan masyarakat. Tanah yang subur, air yang layak, udara yang segar, kesehatan yang terjamin adalah hak-hak masyarakat yang direnggut karena tidak benarnya proses industri kelapa sawit. Lantas untuk siapa keuntungan dari industri kelapa sawit di Indonesia? Pertanyaan tersebut seharusnya menjadi dorongan bagi pemerintah untuk serius memperbaiki masalah ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<strong>Referensi</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nBilkis, M.

Isu tersebut mendulang kontroversi, sebab banyak pihak yang menentang pemulangan ini. Bukan tanpa alasan, penyebaran paham radikal dan aksi terorisme merupakan hal yang perlu diwaspadai. Pada situs Change.org, netizen menandatangani &ldquo;Petisi Menolak Pendukung ISIS Kembali ke Indonesia&rdquo;, yang sampai 25 Juni 2019 telah mencapai angka 13.575 dari target 15.000. Pew Research Center juga membuktikan jika masyarakat Indonesia menilai ISIS sebagai ancaman keamanan terbesar mereka. Namun di sisi lain, Indonesia terikat kebijakan luar negeri mengenai pengakuan status kewarganegaraan. Lalu, bagaimana seharusnya menyikapi para Mantan Militan ISIS tersebut?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHingga kini, tanggapan dari pemerintah masih menjadi perdebatan. Ada klaim penolakan dari Ryamizard Ryacudu, Menteri Pertahanan (Menhan), terkait deportasi tersebut.Sementara itu, Kementerian Luar Negeri (Kemenlu) tidak bisa menjanjikan kepastian apapun, mengingat sukar dan panjangnya prosedur pemulangan eks-ISIS ini. Situasi Suriah yang hancur serta fakta bahwa ada WNI yang pergi ke sana secara ilegal menjadi alasan proses yang berjalan lambat. Hal tersebut menghalangi akses terhadap informasi mengenai jumlah dan data diri WNI yang berada di sana</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAtas nama hak asasi manusia, nasib mantan militan ISIS tersebut tidak bisa serta-merta dibiarkan terombang-ambing. Belum lagi, Indonesia terikat kebijakan yang mengatur hal tersebut. Melihat UU No. 37 tahun 1999 tentang Hubungan Luar Negeri Indonesia Pasal 21 dan 23, Perwakilan RI wajib melindungi da n mengusahakan pemulangan WNI yang terancam bahaya nyata, melalui kerja sama dengan pemerintah setempat, negara lain, maupun organisasi internasional terkait (<a href=\"http://pih.kemlu.go.id/files/UU-No.37.1999_-tentang-Hubungan-Luar-Negeri.pdf\">Kementerian Luar Negeri, 1999</a>). Dalam skala internasional, Konvensi 1961 mengatur jika status individu tanpa kewarganegaraan harus dikurangi dan dicegah, sehingga ada jaminan bahwa setiap orang berhak atas kewarganegaraan (<a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/un-conventions-on-statelessness.html\">UNHCR, 2015</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/CMdi9UjwckZnPG6Y.jpg\" style=\"height:267px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: <a href=\"http://www.jurnas.com/artikel/55606/Pemerintah-Dilema-soal-Pemulangan-WNI-Mantan-ISIS-di-Suriah/\">http://www.jurnas.com/artikel/55606/Pemerintah-Dilema-soal-Pemulangan-WNI-Mantan-ISIS-di-Suriah/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMenolak mentah-mentah deportasi eks-ISIS artinya siap menerima cemooh dari PBB. Namun masalahnya, orang-orang yang mengabdi kepada ISIS&ndash;dengan dalih ingin berjihad&ndash;berarti telah mengakui kedaulatan &ldquo;Negara Islam&rdquo; tersebut dan menanggalkan kewarganegaraannya sebagai WNI. Lalu, setelah kekhilafahan ISIS diruntuhkan Pasukan Demokratik Suriah, mereka ingin pulang. Dengan kata lain, setelah putus dengan Indonesia dan memilih naungan yang dirasa lebih baik, ketika naungan tersebut tidak sanggup memberi lagi apa yang mereka inginkan, akhirnya mereka ingin &ldquo;balikan&rdquo;. Kini, garansi hak asasi manusia dan kewarganegaraan mereka yang menjadi pekerjaan rumah berat karena mempertaruhkan hubungan dan citra politik luar negeri Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPolitik luar negeri berkaitan erat dengan situasi dalam negeri. Mengutip dari Politik Luar Negeri Indonesia di Tengah Pusaran Politik Domestik, bahwa &ldquo;kondisi dan lingkungan domestik yang berubah dari waktu ke waktu menjadi faktor sangat berpengaruh dalam politik luar negeri.&rdquo; (Wuryandari, 2018). Itulah sebabnya, langkah kebijakan pada setiap era berbeda-beda, menyesuaikan kondisi masing-masing. Pada pertemuan ASEAN di Myanmar, Presiden Jokowi di hadapan PBB menegaskan jika ia menolak kekerasan dalam memerangi ISIS dan lebih memilih pendekatan agama dan ideologi (<a href=\"http://ojs.unikom.ac.id/index.php/jipsi/article/view/330\">Tamisari, 2017</a>). Selain itu, menjaga stabilitas keamanan Asia Tenggara juga masih menjadi prioritas. Jadi, mengikuti emosi dan aksi penolakan yang dilakukan rakyat tidak bisa dijadikan pilihan. Tapi apakah pernyataan tersebut sudah benar-benar memberi pengaruh?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sejak awal propaganda ISIS dan munculnya keputusan orang-orang untuk bergabung, sebaran ancaman dan peringatan bagi mereka kurang diperhatikan. Pada kenyataannya, suara masyarakat dan kementerian baru terdengar gaduh saat ini, ketika eks-ISIS mengumumkan ingin pulang. Sekarang, usai semuanya terjadi, malah caci maki dan keluh kesah yang menjadi sorak sorai. Keberadaan kebijakan politik luar negeri tersebut menjadi sama terombang-ambingnya seperti nasib &lsquo;alumni&rsquo; ISIS akibat kurang sinkron dengan pertanggungjawabannya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kebijakan politik luar negeri memang cerminan dari situasi dan kepentingan domestik, tapi yang sulit adalah menjaga agar keduanya tetap seimbang dan saling melengkapi. Menerima kepulangan eks-ISIS dan (tetap) mengakui mereka sebagai WNI adalah aksi kemanusiaan yang menyentuh sekaligus tidak mengkhianati isi undang-undang mengenai pemulangan dan perlindungan WNI. Tapi di sisi lain, paparan radikalisme yang belum tentu benar-benar hilang dapat menimbulkan kecurigaan di kawasan Asia Tenggara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Menolak kembalinya mantan ISIS boleh jadi akan membahayakan posisi Indonesia di mata PBB, padahal tindakan tersebut bisa membantu menjaga kestabilan keamanan dan menunjukkan kesetiaan pada program-program antiterorisme ASEAN. Perlu diingat juga apabila menerima kepulangan ini akan sama saja dengan membuka peluang bagi ideologi lain untuk masuk ke Indonesia.Risiko ini mungkin awalnya tak kasat mata, tapi bukan mustahil untuk disebarkan secara masif. Melihat tanggapan rakyat dan pemerintah yang cukup lambat, agaknya keputusan untuk menerima akan menyusahkan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/9cV6pGJ3Dhu-XBsB.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foto: Ainaya Azkabening</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Memang, saat ini pemerintah dituntut untuk kreatif dalam menyelesaikan setiap isu yang bermunculan. Jadi, berjalannya proses dan keputusan terhadap deportasi eks-ISIS bergantung pada tafsiran aparat pemerintah atas pasal undang-undang terkait dan kerja sama regional maupun internasional. Kemudian, sudah jelas keputusan apapun yang diambil memiliki konsekuensinya masing-masing dan dapat mempengaruhi hubungan Indonesia dengan negara-negara lain. Kembali ditegaskan, bahwa sikap yang konsisten perlu diperhatikan. Pasalnya, reaksi yang ditunjukkan sebelum dan setelah polemik ISIS sudah tidak selaras, sebab ada sikap tak acuh dalam menegur WNI yang ingin berjihad dengan ISIS, sementara kepulangan mereka malah dikecam. Sekarang, luntang-lantung nasib mantan militan ISIS bertumpu pada nasib politik luar negeri Indonesia yang sama terkatungnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Referensi<br />\r\nBuku:<br />\r\nWuryandari, G., dan Dhurorudin Mashad. &quot;<em>Politik Luar Negeri Indonesia di Tengah Pusaran Politik Domestik</em>&quot; (2018).

Kebijakan bebas visa yang diberlakukan pada era kepemimpinan Jokowi tersebut dipertanyakan efektivitas penerapannya. Tujuan diberlakukannya bebas visa Indonesia kepada 169 negara-negara sahabat diharapkan dapat meningkatkan hubungan Indonesia dengan negara lain, dilakukan untuk memberikan kemudahan bagi warga negara asing (WNA) ketika masuk ke wilayah Indonesia dengan membebaskan mereka dari kewajiban memiliki visa kunjungan dengan memperhatikan asas timbal balik dan manfaat. Hal itu juga telah diterapkan oleh negara lain terhadap Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/qqLcy75R26GwgUwF.png\" style=\"height:168px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: <a href=\"https://www.ixigo.com/list-of-countries-offering-visa-free-entry-visa-on-arrival-and-e-visas-to-indian-passport-holders-story-1122170\">https://www.ixigo.com/list-of-countries-offering-visa-free-entry-visa-on-arrival-and-e-visas-to-indian-passport-holders-story-1122170</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPenerapan bebas visa Indonesia diharapkan dapat meningkatkan jumlah kunjungan wisatawan manca negara (wisman), sehingga dapat menambah devisa negara. Untuk melihat efektifitas kebijakan bebas visa dalam meningkatkan&nbsp; kunjungan wisman ke Indonesia, perlu dilihat data sebelum kebijakan tersebut diterapkan. Menurut Badan Pusat Statistika (BPS), dalam waktu tiga tahun (2014-2016) kunjungan wisman pada 2014 berjumlah 9,44 juta kunjungan, pada 2015 berjumlah 10,23 juta kunjungan, dan pada 2016 mencapai 11,52 juta kunjungan (<a href=\"https://www.bps.go.id/statictable/2014/09/08/1394/wisatawan-mancanegara-yang-datang-ke-indonesia-menurut-kebangsaan-2000-2017.html\">Badan Pusat Statistika, 2018</a>). Jumlah kunjungan yang bertambah tersebut merupakan hasil dari kebijakan bebas visa yang awalnya hanya diberikan kepada 11 negara dan kemudian semakin bertambah, puncaknya pada 2016 fasilitas bebas visa diberikan kepada 169 negara sahabat. Lonjakan kunjungan wisman melalui kebijakan bebas visa tersebut memberikan angin segar bagi pariwisata Indonesia, dengan harapan di tahun-tahun berikutnya dapat mendongkrak kunjungan wisman ke Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSetelah penerapan kebijakan bebas visa kepada 169 negara sahabat, data kunjungan wisman per tahun dari 2016-2018 mengalami kenaikan, akan tetapi kenaikan tersebut tidak terlalu signifikan. Peningkatan kunjungan wisman biasanya lebih besar pada musim libur pada bulan Juni, Juli, Agustus, dan di akhir Desember. Selama tahun 2017, total kunjungan wisman mencapai 14,04 juta kunjungan. Selanjutnya pada 2018 kunjungan wisman mencapai 15,81 juta kunjungan. Di tahun 2019, pemerintah berharap kunjungan wisman mencapai 20 juta. Angka tersebut terlampau tinggi apabila kunjungan wisman periode sebelumnya (<a href=\"https://www.bps.go.id/statictable/2014/09/08/1394/wisatawan-mancanegara-yang-datang-ke-indonesia-menurut-kebangsaan-2000-2017.html\">Badan Pusat Statistika, 2018</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peningkatan jumlah wisman terbilang masih kecil walaupun pemberian fasilitas bebas visa telah di berikan ke banyak negara sahabat. Target yang akan dicapai pada 2019 nampaknya masih belum dapat terealisasikan. Salah satu alasannya, beberapa negara yang diberi fasilitas bebas visa bukan merupakan negara-negara yang warga negaranya hobi melancong ke luar negeri. Jika kebijakan bebas visa ingin dimaksimalkan dengan baik, maka pemerintah perlu memberikan informasi kepada negara-negara yang dibebaskan visanya. Karena belum tentu negara-negara sahabat mengetahui kebijakan tersebut. Ketika informasi sudah sampaikan, bukan menjadi jaminan bahwa wisman akan langsung berkunjung ke Indonesia, dibutuhkan waktu bagi wisman untuk menyiapkan kedatangan mereka ke Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walaupun penerapan bebas visa memberikan dampak positif bagi sektor pariwisata lainnya seperti peningkatan bisnis jasa penginapan, terserapnya tenaga kerja untuk bekerja di sektor pariwisata, dan membuka peluang promosi bagi wilayah-wilayah Indonesia untuk dijadikan tempat wisata. Ada dampak negatif yang selalu muncul dalam perdebatan terkait penerapan bebas visa, misalnya pada aspek keamanan, masuknya pekerja ilegal, pengaruh turis asing pada budaya sekitar, sampai paham radikalisme. Dalam penerapan bebas visa, banyak opini kontra yang dilayangkan politisi karena menganggap hal tersebut memberikan kerugian yang sangat berarti. Diantaranya, dengan tidak diberlakukan visa maka Penerimaan Negara Bukan Pajak (PNBP) berkurang banyak. Selain itu, banyak negara yang tidak memberikan keuntungan dan timbal balik sehingga perlu evaluasi terhadap kebijakan tersebut. Salah satu buktinya adalaj ketika Indonesia memberikan bebas visa bagi warga negara Cina yang berkunjung, tetapi Pemerintah Cina tidak memberikan bebas visa bagi warga negara Indonesia (WNI) (<a href=\"http://politeknikimigrasi.ac.id/berita/2016/08/13/realisasi-asas-resiprokal-dalam-pengambilan-kebijakan-bebas-visa-kunjungan\">Priono &amp; Romzah, 2016</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/OvjVADqpsMehoGAV.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foto: Yasmin Salsabila</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPenerapan kebijakan bebas visa pun kurang memberikan keuntungan besar bagi negara seperti yang diharapkan, selain kurangnya informasi, juga kerugian akibat berkurangnya penerimaan negara dari visa, dan masih ditambah dengan kunjungan wisman yang tidak berkualitas. Kategori wisman berkualitas adalah mereka yang akan menghabiskan banyak uang di Indonesia karena memiliki keuangan berlimpah, berpendidikan, peduli dengan alam dan budaya, dan memungkinkan tinggal di Indonesia dalam waktu yang cukup lama (<a href=\"http://travel.detik.com/travel-news/d-2861639/kebijakan-bebas-visa-belum-tentu-dongkrak-devisa-pariwisata\">Yustiana, 2015</a>). Dengan demikian, wisman berkualitas dapat menyumbang devisa negara. Namun kenyataannya bebas visa banyak mengundang wisman tidak berkualitas. Wisman yang kebanyakan adalah backpacker, seringkali mencari destinasi berbiaya murah, dan tidak dikenai biaya visa, serta cenderung berhemat, sehingga mereka kurang dapat membawa keuntungan bagi Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMeskipun kebijakan bebas visa telah diterapkan Indonesia dengan tujuan meningkatkan kunjungan wisman guna menambah devisa, namun kebijakan tersebut dapat dikatakan kurang mampu memberikan peningkatan kunjungan wisman serta devisa negara pertahunnya sejak diimplementasikan. Justru kebijakan bebas visa banyak menimbulkan perdebatan akan efektivitasnya dalam meningkatkan kunjungan wisman, dan perdebatan lainnya terkait dampak negatif yang ditimbulkan. Perlu adanya evaluasi yang segera dilakukan pemerintahan baru yang terbentuk pasca pemilihan umum (Pemilu) di tahun 2019 ini terhadap kebijakan bebas visa tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Referensi</strong>:<br />\r\nBadan Pusat Statistika, &ldquo;Wisatawan Mancanegara yang Datang ke Indonesia Menurut Kebangsaan, 2000-2017&rdquo; diakses 23 Juni 2019. <a href=\"http://www.bps.go.id/statictable/2014/09/08/1394/wisatawan-mancanegara-yang-datang-ke-indonesia-menurut-kebangsaan-2000-2017.html\">www.bps.go.id/statictable/2014/09/08/1394/wisatawan-mancanegara-yang-datang-ke-indonesia-menurut-kebangsaan-2000-2017.html</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nErdian, &ldquo;Efektivitas Penerapan Kebijakan Bebas Visa Kunjungan Dikaitkan dengan Selective Policy Keimigrasian Indonesia,&rdquo; Kemenkumham Jabar, 27 Februari 2018, diakses 23 Juni 2019. <a href=\"http://jabar.kemenkumham.go.id/pusat-informasi/artikel/efektivitas-penerapan-kebijakan-bebas-visa-kunjungan-dikaitkan-dengan-selective-policy-keimigrasian-indonesia-erdian\">jabar.kemenkumham.go.id/pusat-informasi/artikel/efektivitas-penerapan-kebijakan-bebas-visa-kunjungan-dikaitkan-dengan-selective-policy-keimigrasian-indonesia-erdian</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjdut-j8ZXkAhXY7XMBHap6DEYQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpih.kemlu.go.id%2Ffiles%2FPerpres_21_thn_2016_tentang_Bebas_Visa_Kunjungan.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0DlvYzx8CdTwbZcf_ePq5L\">Peraturan Presiden Republik Indonesia No.21 Tahun 2016 tentang Bebas Visa Kunjungan</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPriono, Setio Utomo, Romzah,&nbsp; M.

Ini merupakan ke-empat kalinya Indonesia berkesempatan memegang posisi ini, sebelumnya pada tahun 1974-1975, 1995-1996, dan 2007-2008 Indonesia juga sempat menjabat sebagai Anggota Tidak Tetap DK PBB. Antusiasme masyarakat untuk prestasi Indonesia yang telah diperjuangkan sejak jauh jauh hari ditunjukan lewat ucapan apresiasi dan dukungan di berbagai media sosial. Ada rasa bangga yang dirasakan masyarakat saat melihat nama Indonesia kembali didengar di dunia internasional yang secara langsung akan menaikkan prestis Indonesia di mata dunia. Bekerja bersama Jerman, Afrika Selatan, Belgia dan Republik Dominika, Indonesia mulai menjalani masa tugasnya pada tanggal 1 Januari 2019- 31 Desember 2020 (<a href=\"https://kemlu.go.id/portal/id/page/42/keanggotaan-indonesia-pada-dk-pbb\">Kementerian Luar Negeri Republik Indonesia, 2019</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSegera setelah Indonesia secara resmi menjadi bagian dari kelompok ekslusif yang menjadi pembuat kebijakan dalam level internasional tersebut, tim dari Kementerian Luar Negeri Indonesia segera mengadakan seminar di berbagai universitas dan instansi untuk mempromosikan dan memberikan pengertian kepada masyrakat mengenai apa saja yang menjadi fokus pekerjaan serta strategi Indonesia di DK PBB, salah satu universitas yang dipilih untuk dikunjungi adalah UGM. Dengan slogannya, A True Partner for World Peace yang menjadi andalan Indonesia selama masa kampanye, Indonesia memberikan fokus perhatian pada isu-isu perdamaian dan stabilitas global serta partnership, dengan memberikan atensi khusus pada isu Palestina (<a href=\"https://kemlu.go.id/portal/id/page/42/keanggotaan-indonesia-pada-dk-pbb\">Kementerian Luar Negeri Republik Indonesia, 2019</a>). Melihat posisi penting yang selalu menjadi incaran negara-negara anggota PBB yang saat ini diampu oleh Indonesia, tentu sudah seharusnya Indonesia memanfaatkannya waktu dua tahun ini dengan baik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/S5GmqLLzs8avCZYL.jpg\" style=\"height:162px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: <a href=\"https://kemlu.go.id/portal/id/page/42/keanggotaan-indonesia-pada-dk-pbb\">https://kemlu.go.id/portal/id/page/42/keanggotaan-indonesia-pada-dk-pbb</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBagaimana posisi sebagai anggota tidak tetap Dewan Keamanan PBB menjadi suatu posisi yang banyak diincar negara-negara, baik negara maju maupun negara berkembang? Dengan kuasa yang datang seiringan dengan jabatan bonafid ini tentu tidak heran bahwa setiap negara selalu berupaya mendapatkannya melalui berbagai strategi. Lalu apa dengan terpilihnya Indonesia akan membawa dampak yang baik bagi Indonesia? Sebagai bagian dari level tertinggi PBB, Indonesia akan dilibatkan dengan berbagai perumusan kebijakan yang gagal diselesaikan di bagian tubuh PBB yang lain seperti sanksi ekonomi, dan aksi militer kolektif. Ada tiga poin yang membuat negara berlomba-lomba mendapatkan posisi tersebut menurut David Malone (Malone, 2000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pertama</em>, menjadi anggota tidak tetap UNSC (United Nations Security Councils) akan mendapatkan prestis internasional, melihat UNSC sebagai bagian terpenting PBB, negara-negara tentu ingin mengambil bagian di dalamnya demi <em>interest</em> mereka masing masing. <em>Kedua</em>, Malone menekankan pada <em>states&rsquo; positioning</em> dalam konflik di depan <em>Council</em>, negara yang menjadi bagian dari konflik akan kehilangan haknya dalam pemilihan suara (<a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/un-charter-full-text/\">United Nations, n.d.</a>) yang kemudian memunculkan perdebatan mengenai definisi &ldquo;konflik&rdquo;, akhirnya anggota <em>Council</em> akan memiliki <em>upper hand</em> dalam perdebatan ini. <em>Ketiga</em>, negara dapat secara efektif mengejar <em>interest</em> mereka secara lebih efisien, dengan membawa topik tertentu pada area bahasan dan diskusi dewan dipercaya akan mempengaruhi hasil yang positif. Oleh sebab itu, <em>power</em> sebenarnya bukan sesuatu yang paling diincar saat sebuah negara berusaha menempati posisi dalam UNSC, hal utamanya adalah prestis dan informasi yang didapat dengan menjadi bagian dari pembuat kebijakan di level tertinggi. Akan ada rasa bangga dan naiknya nama sebuah negara saat berhasil tergabung dalam kelompok kecil ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLatar belakang Indonesia untuk ikut tergabung dalam <em>non-permanent member</em> dari UNSC dapat pula dipengaruhi upaya Indonesia untuk mempertahankan <em>dignity</em> di dunia internasional. Menurut Francis Fukuyama, ada tiga fenomena yang digabungkan oleh konsep modern dari identitas (Fukuyama, 2018). <em>Pertama</em>, aspek universal dari kepribadian manusia yang menginginkan pengakuan. <em>Kedua</em>, perbedaan antara batin dan luar diri dan peningkatan penilaian moral batin atas masyarakat luar, yang terjadi hanya pada awal masa modern Eropa. <em>Ketiga</em>, konsep <em>dignity</em> yang berkembang dimana pengakuan bukan hanya karena kelompok orang yang kecil tapi juga bagi semua orang. Ada keinginan untuk mendapatkan pengakuan <em>dignity</em> yang setara. Bisa jadi ini adalah salah satu alasan Indonesia bergabung dalam UNSC, ada dorongan untuk menuntut<em> recognition</em> dan <em>dignity</em> dengan cara masuk dalam level tertinggi pembuat kebijakan internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/Tr6z3yY9gTbruV-G.jpg\" style=\"height:225px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foto: Sasha Aryaldina</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Posisi sekaliber anggota tidak tetap Dewan Keamanan PBB memang posisi yang patut diperjuangkan, dengan sederet keuntungan yang didapat Indonesia tentu bukan hal yang salah apabila Indonesia dengan semangat dan ambisi tinggi berusaha mendapatkannya. Ditambah dengan dua analisa yang diperkuat dengan pendapat dua tokoh diatas menjelaskan mengapa Indonesia sangat antusias mengejar posisi ini. Lewat pendapat David Malone yang menjelaskan keuntungan-keuntungan yang didapat Indonesia jika memperoleh posisi ini, seperti prestis internasional dan informasi serta kewenangan yang lebih dari negara-negara lain. Lalu pendapat Francis Fukuyama yang membicarakan mengenai <em>dignity</em> dan <em>struggle for recognition</em>, bagaimana suatu negara akan melakukan hal-hal demi pengakuan atas harga diri negara tersebut. Seperti berupaya terlibat langsung dalam aksi-aksi internasional yang membuat negaranya diakui dalam kacah internasional. Hal ini menjadi faktor mengapa Indonesia terdorong untuk ambil bagian dalam tingkat tertinggi sistem perpolitikan internasional ini, ada keinginan dari Indonesia untuk mendapatkan prestis dan upaya mendapatkan pengakuan dari publik internasional.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Referensi:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buku:<br />\r\nFukuyama, Francis. &ldquo;<em>Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment</em>&rdquo; (2018).

Trump juga dikenal rasis karena membenci orang-orang negara-negara Islam, Amerika Latin, keturunan Afrika di Amerika. Bahkan sejak terpilih sebagai presiden banyak keturunan tergoncang karena Trump secara terbuka mengusung kesombongan <em>white supremacy</em>, bahkan imigran Amerika Tengah disebutnya sebaga gerombolan kriminal yg akan menyerbu Amerika.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id: Politik Luar Negeri adalah cerminan dari politik domestik.

Kebijakan menarik diri dari Perjanjian Paris, dari TPP (<em>Trans Pacific Partnership</em>), perang dagang dengan China semua itu bertujuan bagaimana Amerika mendapatkan keuntungan sebanyak mungkin bagi bangsa Amerika mengingat defisit neraca dagang dengan China dan Eropa yang sangat besar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/PIenajtKmXNYVf7C.jpg\" style=\"height:224px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: Prof. Bambang Cipto</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id: Trump terpilih sebagai Presiden Amerika Serikat melalui cara-cara yang demokratis terlepas dari kebijakan kontroversial (atau sebut saja otoriter) yang dia ambil baik di domestik maupun internasional.

Dengan kata lain, kondisi Amerika Serikat saat ini adalah cerminan dari keinginan masyarakatnya sendiri. Apakah anda menganggap hal ini sebagai ambruknya kredibilitas demokrasi? Bagaimana pendapat anda?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B.C: Ambrunyaknya kredibilitas demokrasi terjadi disebabkan kompleksitas permasalahan yang menghadang kelangsungan demokrasi Amerika saat ini. Faktor-faktor itu adalah:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(1) Ketimpangan pendapatan yang luar biasa di Amerika dan sampai tingkat tertentu di Eropa. tahun 2018 ada sekitar 33 perusahaan besar yang menggaji CEO-nya 1000 kali gaji buruh. Padahal selama 40 tahun terakhir gaji buruh mengalami stagnasi alias tidak pernah mengalami kenaikan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2) Globalisasi ternyata menyebabkah penumpukan kekayan dikalangan elit semata-mata dan mengabaikan sama sekali nasib buruh</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3) Kepercayaan publik terhadap para elit turun hingga dibawah 50% karena mereka dianggap tak mampu menciptakan kesejahteraan bagi rakyat di negara-negara Barat</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(4) Kepercayaan milenial terhadap demokrasi benar-benar merosot tajam. Mereka lebih memilih kepemimpinan militer daripada sipil yang mampu meningkatkan kesejahteraan mereka.

Tentang bagaimana hubungan suatu negara dengan negara lain, peran diplomasi menjadi hal paling penting. Seiring berkembangnya zaman, makin banyak hal yang dapat dikaji untuk mengembangkan jenis-jenis dilomasi itu sendiri. Kini, makanan pun bisa menjadi alat diplomasi yang penting bagi hubungan antar negara. Makanan khas suatu negara dilirik sebagai sebuah&nbsp; potensi yang menggiurkan untuk memperhalus hubungan antar negara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berangkat dari nilai-nilai tradisional masing-masing negara, yang menjadikan hal tersebut sebagai ciri khas, makanan juga memiliki arti tersendiri bagi sekelompok masyarakat yang didalamnya memuat nilai tradisional, tradisi, bahkan letak geografis. Makanan kini digunakan sebagai sarana untuk mempengaruhi, menyalurkan budaya, serta identitas dari sebuah negara. Makanan menjadi sarana komunikasi nonverbal yang sangat kuat untuk mengubah persepsi publik internasional dan mempromosikan negara di panggung global (Pujayanti, 2017). Diplomasi cara ini, lebih dikenal dengan istilah <em>Gastrodiplomacy</em>, yang dianggap dapat menjadi sarana dan alat dalam meningkatkan<em> Branding Nation</em> suatu negara (Baskoro, 2017). <em>Gastrodiplomacy</em> sendiri dipopulerkan oleh Paul Rockower yang mengatakan bahwa adanya komunikasi <em>nonverbal</em> yang datang dari <em>Gastrodiplomacy</em> ini sendiri merupakan cara yang efektif dalam penyatuan semua kalangan (Rockower, 2014). Dalam penjelasan Rockower dikatakan &ldquo;<em>Gastrodiplomacy seeks to enhance the edible nation brand through cultural diplomacy that highlights and promotes awareness and understanding of national culinary culture with wide swathes of foreign publics</em>.&rdquo; (Rockower, 2014).<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThailand dalam hal ini dapat diambil sebagai contoh praktik Gastrodiplomasi yang berhasil di kawasan Asia Tenggara sejauh ini. Thailand memanfaatkan makanan khasnya sebagai strategi <em>soft power diplomacy</em> mereka untuk merubah image negara wisata seks menjadi negara dengan kuliner yang kaya dan lezat. Hal tersebut terbukti dengan banyaknya restoran Thailand yang tersebar di berbagai negara, dan yang menjadi hal penting disini, pembangunan restoran Thailand di berbagai negara ini dilakukan langsung oleh pemerintah Thailand untuk mempromosikan kuliner juga kebudayaan Thailand sendiri. (Pujayanti, 2017) Keberhasilan <em>Gastrodiplomacy</em> Thailand juga terbukti dengan banyaknya produk kuliner Thailand yang kini merambah ke segala lapisan masyarakat, apalagi di Indonesia,seperti thai tea kemudian tom yum, dan juga padthai yang memang sudah sejak lama menjadi makanan populer di banyak negara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/qXhKQvFxhlvztPw0.jpg\" style=\"height:225px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image</em>: <a href=\"https://www.liputan6.com/lifestyle/read/3677149/video-gastrodiplomacy-diplomasi-lewat-makanan-indonesia\">https://www.liputan6.com/lifestyle/read/3677149/video-gastrodiplomacy-diplomasi-lewat-makanan-indonesia</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indonesia, seperti yang kita ketahui, sangat kaya dengan budaya, bahasa, dan tentu saja kuliner, seharusnya dapat menjadikan <em>Gastrodiplomacy</em> sebagai peluang untuk memperluas persebaran budayanya ke kancah global. Namun, sungguh sangat disayangkan, Indonesia belum mampu menjadikan <em>Gastrodiplomacy </em>sebagai sarana memperluas dan menyalurkan budaya-budaya di Indonesia. Dalam satu kawasan seperti Jawa Tengah saja makanan khas daerahnya sudah beragam dengan pengaruh tradisi, budaya serta lokasi geografis. Masih menjadi pertanyaan tentang mengapa Indonesia belum bisa mencapai tujuan <em>Nation Branding</em> yang berusaha dibentuk melalui jalur kuliner. Belum seperti Thailand yang dikenal dengan tom yum nya, Indonesia belum memilki satu kuliner khas yang dapat di-branding sebagai &ldquo;makanan khas Indonesia&rdquo;. Bagaimana dengan rendang? Hal ini memang seringkali menjadi perdebatan. Rendang belum dapat dikategorikan sebagai makanan pengikat yang di branding dengan makanan khas Indonesia, karena proses pembuatan Rendang di satu daerah belum tentu sama dengan yang ada di daerah asalnya, yakni tanah Minang. Ditambah dengan adanya faktor historis seperti persebaran suku bangsa ke wilayah Malaysia membuat klaim rendang sebagai makanan asli Indonesia di mata dunia internasional kurang kuat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ada beberapa alasan mengapa Indonesia belum dapat menggunakan Gastrodiplomasi. Yang pertama belum adanya ikon kuliner yang cocok untuk dibawa ke internasional dan diperkenalkan sebagai makanan Indonesia, karena banyaknya kuliner dari berbagi daerah di Indonesia dan masing-masing dari mereka blm dapat mewakili kekhasan Indonesia secara general. Kemudian selain itu para pelaku usaha makanan kemasan Indonesia terhambat oleh adanya regulasi safety food di tingkat Internasional. Makanan kemasan untuk ekspor harus memenuhi syarat keamanan pangan internasional dengan sistem&nbsp; Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point&nbsp; (HACCP) (Pujayanti, 2017, hal. 50). Adanya sistem ini bertujuan untuk mengadakan pengawasan mutu dan keamanan makanan.&nbsp; Dengan adanya standart ini, sulit bagi usaha makanan UMKM Indonesia yang ingin menembus pasar internasional. Dan diluar kedua hal itu, memang pemerintah Indonesia masih belum memfokuskan diri pada sektor <em>Gastrodiplomacy</em> ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/t3IzW5MZ4HSuUALq.jpeg\" style=\"height:400px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foto: Nindy Silvia Anggraini</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Namun, seolah mampu membaca potensi dan tidak mau menyianyiakan kesempatan yang ada, Presiden RI Joko Widodo berusaha melancarkan upaya<em> Gastrodiplomacy</em> dengan cara yang begitu halus. Presiden yang kerap di sapa Jokowi ini melancarkan upaya <em>Gastrodiplomacy</em>nya dengan cara menyajikan makanan dan kopi tradisional kami setiap kali ia menerima Kepala Negara / Kepala Pemerintahan (Office of Assistant to Deputy Cabinet Secretary for State, 2018). Upaya sepeti ini dianggap cukup efektif untuk langkah awal <em>Gastrodiplomacy</em> yakni pengenalan. Kemudian dalam pemerintahan Jokowi, <em>Gastrodiplomacy</em> digadang-gadang sebagai salah satu fokus diplomasi Indonesia kedepannya. Hal tersebut dibuktikan dengan adanya Seminar Nasional Gastronomi dengan tema &ldquo;<em>Peran Gastronomi Indonesia dalam Meningkatkan Gastro-preneurship dan Memperkuat Diplomasi Indonesia</em>&rdquo; sebagai salah satu upaya memperkenalkan kuliner Indonesia lewat industri pariwisata yang ada (Office of Assistant to Deputy Cabinet Secretary for State, 2018). Seminar yang diadakan bekerja sama antara Sekretariat Kabinet dan Asosiasi Gastronomi Indonesia (IGA) ini diikuti oleh delegasi dari 34 pemerintah provinsi dan 8 perwakilan kabupaten / kota, kementerian / lembaga terkait, asosiasi, serta akademisi dan praktisi gastronomi sebagai anggota IGA (Office of Assistant to Deputy Cabinet Secretary for State, 2018).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dapat dilihat disini bahwa meskipun Gastrodiplomasi di Indonesia menemukan banyak tantangan, namun dalam pemerintahan Jokowi, praktiknya mulai dikembangkan perlahan. Melalui hal sederhana seperti menjamu tamu, diharapkan kedepannya kuliner Indonesia dapat dijadikan alat perantara hubungan yang akan terjalin baik diantara Indonesia dengan negara-negara lain diluar sana. Dengan begitu pula, kebudayaan Indonesia nantinya dapat dikenal dan diakui kekayaannya oleh dunia Internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBibliography<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiCt8XRvvbkAhUE4o8KHXkMDG8QFjAAegQIAhAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fjos.unsoed.ac.id%2Findex.php%2Finsignia%2Farticle%2Fdownload%2F666%2F496%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Sxww7LOLBIZGf4tcen7Hz\">Baskoro, R.

Mohammad Hatta memaknai &ldquo;bebas&rdquo; sebagai ketidakberpihakan Indonesia dalam blok tertentu dan &ldquo;aktif&rdquo; sebagai partisipasi penuh dalam upaya menjaga perdamaian dunia (Hatta, 1976). Hal ini kemudian dikristalkan sebagai tujuan nasional yang tertera dalam Pembukaan UUD 1945 alinea keempat. Bertolak dari dasar negara tersebut, ketertiban dunia yang didambakan oleh Indonesia mencakup lingkup internasional dan tidak terpasung pada batas nasional atau regional semata. Beberapa dekade telah berlalu sejak pencetusan orientasi politik luar negeri tersebut dan hingga kini,semangat yang sama tetap digaungkan oleh para diplomat Indonesia.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Amanat para pendiri bangsa untuk menjaga perdamaian dunia tersebut tetap dijaga dan dipelihara, salah satunya diimplementasikan melalui partisipasi aktif dalam <em>United Nations Peace Keeping Operations</em> (UNPKO) atau Pasukan Penjaga Perdamaian PBB. UNPKO merupakan instrumen penting bagi PBB yang digunakan untuk menjaga dan memilihara perdamaian dunia (United Nations, 2018). </span></span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Di bawah naungan <em>UN Blue Helmet, </em>seluruh negara mengirimkan pasukan terbaiknya untuk tergabung dalam misi keamanan internasional.

Beberapa melaksanakan secara penuh amanat ini, beberapa hanya mengirimkan segelintir personel, beberapa hanya memberikan bantuan finansial, dan tidak sedikit pula yang total abai atas tanggung jawab ini. Tidak adanya titik temu antara kepentingan suatu negera dengan agenda kemanusiaan yang dijalankan oleh UNPKO merupakan kausa realis di balik partisipasi pasif sejumlah negara.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/znq3qCWH7O9ecAHk.png\" style=\"height:400px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/indonesia\">https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/indonesia</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Fenomena ini lantas menimbulkan pertanyaan dan sekelumit spekulasi tentang adanya motif di balik partisipasi aktif suatu negara. Benarkah kontribusi negara berlandaskan asas kemanusiaan dan dijalankan atas dasar iktikad baik negara? Atau sejatinya terdapat kepentingan-kepentingan yang diselundupkan bersama pengerahan pasukan ini? Perdebatan ini dijelaskan oleh Laura Neack (1995) yang melihatnya dari dua perspektif berseberangan, yaitu melalui perspektif idealis dan perspektif realis. Asumsi pertama menyatakan bahwa partisipasi negara dalam UNPKO bersifat altruistik yang dilatarbelakangi oleh kewajiban untuk menjaga perdamaian internasional, bahkan ketika ia tidak memiliki kepentingan dalam upaya tersebut. Hal ini terjadi karena adanya dorongan dari nilai-nilai normatif internasional. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Sedangkan asumsi kedua menjelaskan bahwa keterlibatan ini digunakan sebagai sarana dalam mencapai kepentingan negara, dimana dalam perspektif ini kepentingan nasional tidak terbatas pada <em>hard issues </em>seperti militer dan keamanan semata, melainkan juga mencakup kepentingan ekonomi dan prestise negara. Dalam pratiknya, terdapat relasi dominasi yang terjalin antara kepentingan nasional dan sisi kemanusiaan negara yang altruistik. Sebagaimana pepatah <em>ada udang di balik batu, </em>negara selalu memiliki motif tersembunyi di balik tindakan kemanusiaan yang dilakukannya. Kepentingan nasional dapat dilihat sebagai baterai yang menggerakkan negara untuk berpartisipasi dalam aksi kemanusiaan. Dengan adanya daya penggerak tersebut, negara akan berkontribusi lebih aktif dalam agenda kemanusiaan. Sehingga apa yang disebut sebagai tindakan kemanusiaan altruistik &ndash; mengulurkan bantuan tanpa mengindahkan kepentingan nasional dan tanpa mengharap timbal balik &ndash; bagi negara merupakan suatu hal yang terlalu idealis karena kepentingan negara merupakan suatu prioritas. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Sejak keikutsertaannya dalam operasi ini, Indonesia telah menoreh sederet pujian atas profesionalitas dan kontribusinya selama mengemban misi pasukan perdamaian. Pada tahun 1957, Indonesia mengirimkan kontingen pertamanya pada misi perdamaian di Terusan Suez, Timur Tengah. Setelahnya, Indonesia banyak mengerahkan personelnya yang tergabung dalam Kontingen Garuda. Partisipasi Indonesia dalam UNPKO memang dipandang sebagai refleksi dari pengamalan tujuan nasional dan diteguhkan dalam beberapa dokumen hukum mengenai penyebaran pasukan penjaga perdamaian dari Indonesia (Hutabarat, 2018). </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Meskipun fondasi utama bagi partisipasi Indonesia telah ditetapkan sejak 1945, namun dapat dikatakan bahwa signifikasi peran aktif Indonesia dimulai pada era pemerintahan Presiden Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY). Hal ini disebabkan oleh latar belakang militer yang dimilikinya dan orientasi kebijakan luar negerinya yang merujuk pada citra positif &ldquo;<em>Million Friends, Zero Enemy&rdquo;. </em>Nilai-nilai yang dianut Presiden SBY ini memengaruhi proses pengambilan keputusan dalam kebijakan luar negeri Indonesia pada era tersebut. Sederet prestasi telah diraih Presiden SBY dalam sepuluh tahun masa kepemimpinannya, seperti <em>Roadmap Vision 4.000 Peacekeepers 2015-2019</em> hingga pembentukan Tim Koordinasi Misi Pemeliharaan Perdamaian (TKMPP). Meski membawa nilai-nilai yang berbeda, namun visi 4.000 Penjaga Perdamaian tersebut tetap diemban hingga era pemerintahan Presiden Jokowi. Lalu apakah keterlibatan Indonesia dalam UNPKO sepenuhnya terbebas dari penyelundupan kepentingan nasional?</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/c11cy3ijqg3Ud2iA.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Foto: <span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Nadhifa Aliya Amani</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Menggunakan kacamata kritis, partisipasi aktif dalam setiap operasi yang dijalankan oleh UNPKO dapat dipandang sebagai ajang pembuktian citra baik negara di kancah internasional. Pengiriman personel dan pembiayaan finansial dewasa ini telah dikonstruksi sebagai bentuk cinta suatu negara terhadap perdamaian. Citra baik ini kemudian digunakan bak pengeras suara agar aspirasi dan suara negara dapat didengar dalam forum internasional. Partisipasi aktif Indonesia di UNPKO memiliki implikasi pada sifat kooperatif dalam upaya pemeliharaan perdamaian dan keamanan dunia dimana hal ini merupakan karakteristik penting yang dibutuhkan oleh anggota tidak tetap Dewan Keamanan (DK) PBB. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Bukan suatu kebetulan bahwa partisipasi Indonesia dalam UNPKO mengalami peningkatan pada awal pemerintahan Presiden SBY tahun 2004. Untuk status keanggotaan periode 2007-2008, pemilihan anggota tidak tetap DK PBB dilaksanakan pada tahun 2006 dan dua tahun merupakan jangka waktu produktif bagi Pemerintah Indonesia untuk menggencarkan kampanye. Dengan menjual citra baik tersebut, Indonesia berhasil menduduki kursi anggota tidak tetap DK PBB periode 2007-2008. Pola serupa dapat dilihat di masa kepemimpinan Presiden Jokowi. Menggunakan <em>Roadmap Vision 4.000 Peacekeepers 2015-2019</em>, Indonesia kembali menyandang gelar tersebut untuk periode 2019-2020, setelah memenangkan pemilihan yang dilaksanakan pada Juni 2018 silam. Disamping itu, langkah ini juga membawa arus positif dari dalam negeri. Isu kemanusiaan dan partisipasi dalam operasi perdamaian dianggap trendi dan menarik oleh masyarakat secara umum. Partisipasi ini berhasil merangkul Warga Negara Indonesia dan tentara Indonesia dalam satu tajuk kebanggaan nasional.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Dilihat dari segi ekonomi, partisipasi UNPKO menjadi menguntungkan karena mengakomodasi promosi peralatan militer buatan Indonesia. Hal ini menyediakan ruang bagi industri strategis Indonesia untuk melakukan manuver dalam komersialisasi persenjataan. Sejauh ini, taktik ini telah ditempuh untuk memperkenalkan senjata dan kendaraan militer buatan Indonesia yang memenuhi standar internasional. Namun sejauh ini, strategi tersebut dinilai belum mendatangkan profit yang berarti. Dalam konotasi yang lebih positif, partisipasi UNPKO merupakan suatu sarana efektif untuk memperoleh pengalaman internasional. Hal ini berguna sebagai cara strategis untuk mengevaluasi kinerja dan meningkatkan kualitas pasukan keamanan Indonesia dengan melakukan studi banding secara langsung dengan negara lain di lapangan. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Keterlibatan dalam operasi Pasukan Penjaga Perdamaian PBB merupakan tanggung jawab bersama guna mewujudkan perdamaian dunia. Kendati demikian, beberapa negara memilih mangkir dalam pelaksanaan misi tersebut. Fenomena ini kemudian menimbulkan tanda tanya besar terkait motif terselubung dalam keterlibatan aktif negara pada misi sukarela ini. Masyarakat internasional mulai menyangsikan iktikad baik negara yang bertindak atas nama solidaritas kemanusiaan. Karena pada hakikatnya, negara akan mendahulukan kepentingan nasional sebagai prioritas utamanya. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Referensi:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Hatta, Mohammad. &ldquo;<em>Mendayung di Antara Dua Karang</em>&rdquo; (1976).

Moazzam Malik dalam suratnya tersebut juga menitipkan sebuah pesan yang salah satunya adalah melindungi kaum minoritas yang berada di Indonesia. Pesan Moazzam Malik tersebut seketika mengingatkan kembali kepada saya mengenai kondisi politik di Indonesia saat ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/25sMt7ZzEiAfPEJO.jpg\" style=\"height:279px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: <a href=\"http://www.salampapua.com/2018/05/teroris-di-mimika-rakyat-jangan-takut.html\">http://www.salampapua.com/2018/05/teroris-di-mimika-rakyat-jangan-takut.html</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSeperti yang diketahui bahwa mayoritas masyarakat Indonesia merupakan pemeluk agama islam. Bahkan Presiden Jokowi sering sekali memberikan pernyataan di dalam pidatonya di Indonesia maupun di dunia Internasional bahwa Indonesia adalah negara berpenduduk muslim terbesar di dunia. Presiden Jokowi selalu menceritakan bahwa islam yang berada di Indonesia adalah islam moderat. Dimana islam moderat sangat menjunjung tinggi nilai toleransi dan nasionalisme. Namun tidak dapat dipungkiri bahwa di Indonesia sendiri masih terdapat kelompok-kelompok islam yang radikal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPasca era orde baru yaitu era reformasi, jalur-jalur demokrasi dibuka seluas-luasnya bagi masyarakat untuk turut berpartisipasi dalam berbagai proses politik secara sukarela. Era reformasi juga memasuki babakan baru dengan mendatangkan liberalisasi politik. Pada era reformasi ini, partai-partai islam mulai bangkit lagi di panggung perpolitikan Indonesia. Tidak hanya itu, pada era reformasi, Indonesia menjadi sebuah &ldquo;sasaran empuk&rdquo; bagi ideologi-ideologi baru yang mana salah satu diantaranya adalah ideologi islam radikal yang terus berkembang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBerkembangnya kelompok-kelompok islam radikal di Indonesia tentu saja menjadi sebuah ancaman bagi kehidupan Indonesia, tidak hanya dalam kehidupan politik domestik namun politik luar negeri juga dapat terancam. Kehadiran gerakan islam radikal di Indonesia dapat mencoreng citra Indonesia di mata dunia internasional. Hal ini dikarenakan doktrin dan ajaran yang dibawa oleh kelompok gerakan islam radikal tidak sesuai dengan ajaran nilai dan norma Pancasila. Seperti yang diketahui bahwa salah satu doktrin yang dibawa oleh ajaran islam radikan adalah tidak membenarkan dan tidak menghormati ajaran agama atau kepercayaan lain. Sehingga kehadiran kelompok islam radikal di Indonesia dapat meningkatkan tensi intoleransi yang ada di Indonesia. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPemerintah Indonesia telah berupaya membangun citra baiknya di dunia internasional dengan membangun Bangsa Indonesia sebagai bangsa yang menjujung tinggi nilai toleransi dengan islam moderat yang dimilikinya. Selain itu keaktifan Indonesia dalam dunia internasional dimana telah beberapa kali berhasil menjadi penengah dalam konflik identitas di suatu negara seperti halnya di Myanmar dan Afghanistan. Upaya Indonesia dalam memperjuangkan kemerdekaan Palestina juga diapresiasi oleh dunia internasional sehingga Indonesia dapat terpilih sebagai anggota Dewan Keamanan Tidak Tetap Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa (PBB).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUpaya-upaya Pemerintah Indonesia diatas dalam rangka untuk membangun citra Bangsa Indonesia di dunia internasional dapat tercoreng dengan kondisi domestik Indonesia dimana nilai toleransi sedang dalam masa krisis. Gerakan islam radikal yang sedang terus berupaya mengembangkan ajarannya di Indonesia dapat memicu meningkatnya intoleransi antar masyarakat Indonesia. Adanya upaya mendirikan negara khilafah oleh Hizbut Tahrir Indonsia (HTI) merupakan salah satu bukti bahwa wajah islam di Indonesia saat ini tidak hanya wajah islam yang moderat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/EZXiDOF9ljdVGcwt.jpg\" style=\"height:629px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: Pradipta Chandra Kusuma</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPerlu diketahui bahwa pendekatan islam moderat merupakan pendekatan yang digunakan oleh Pemerintah Indonesia dalam melakukan diplomasi. Ditengah-tengah isu internasional yang meragukan kredibelitas islam atau bahkan beberapa negara mengatakan bahwa islam adalah teroris. Indonesia sebagai negara yang memiliki masyarakat mayoritas pemeluk islam dengan tegas menyerukan ke dunia internasional bahwa islam yang ada di Indonesia adalah islam moderat bukan islam radikal. Oleh karena itu kehadiran gerakan islam radikal di Indonesia tentu saja dapat dijadikan sebuah tantangan pada diplomasi Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nGerakan islam radikal di Indonesia yang sudah saya sampaikan sebelumnya dapat mencoreng citra Bangsa Indonesia di dunia internasional. Oleh karena itu, apabila kondisi domestik Indonesia terus-terusan seperti ini dimana nilai toleransi antar masyarakat menurun maka kredibelitas Indonesia sebagai negara yang menjunjung tinggi nilai toleransi untuk menciptakan perdamaian dunia melalui ajaran islam moderat Indonesia yang di bawa oleh Pemerintah Indonesia sebagai sarana diplomasi Indonesia akan dipertanyakan. Maka kepercayaan yang telah dibangun oleh dunia internasional mengenai toleransi dan islam moderat yang ditawarkan oleh Indonesia di dunia internasional akan menurun. Hal ini tentu saja menjadi sebuah tantangan bagi Pemerintah Indoensia untuk terus berupaya menjaga kestabilan kehidupan bernegara masyarakan Indonesia di dalam negeri. Oleh karena itu sangat penting bagi masyarakat Indonesia untuk lebih memahami dan menerapkan nilai-nilai Pancasila di kehidupan sehari-hari. Hal ini tentu saja dapat sebagai bentuk dukungan masyarakat kepada Pemerintah Indonesia dalam menjalankan politik luar negeri di dunia internasional. Karena diplomasi merupakan hal terpenting dalam menjalankan politik luar negeri, sehingga Pemerintah Indonesia dapat menjalankan politik luar negerinya dengan baik untuk menciptakan perdamain dunia dan membangun Indonesia lebih baik lagi di kancah internasional</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Tantangan dalam Agenda Diplomasi Indonesia','','102019',2,1,755,NULL,1572238800,1572261895,1607067705,1,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,761),
(36,25,1,'Kebijakan Luar Negeri Indonesia di Kawasan Arktik Harus Diubah','',NULL,'<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPenulis: Sandi Saputra (Mahasiswa Magister Jurusan Regional Studies Northern (Arctic) Federal University)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Editor: Randhi Satria</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tulisan ini bertujuan untuk merespon hasil penelitian dari tim peneliti dari Universitas Indonesia dan pemerintah Indonesia yang masih melihat kawasan Arktik bukan merupakan kawasan strategis dalam kebijakan luar negeri nya. Kebijakan Indonesia terhadap kawasan Arktik saat in ini dipengaruhi oleh hasil studi Kementrian Luar Negeri Indonesia yang bekerjasama dengan Universitas Indonesia pada tahun 2014 dengan judul &ldquo;<em>Peran Arctic Council dalam menciptakan Keamanan, Kemakmuran Ekonomi dan perdamaian dalam perspektif Indonesia</em>&rdquo;. Penelitian tersebut dilakukan oleh peneliti utama Evi Fitiriani, PhD., Yuni R. Intarti, M.A. dan Andrew W. Mantong, M.Sc dan dua orang asisten peneliti yaitu Aisha R. Kusumasomantri, S. Sos., dan Cazadira F. Tamzil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Hasil penelitian itu terbagi menjadi lima bagian:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<em>Pertama</em>, menempatkan Arktik sebagai kawasan yang krusial bagi manusia dan kerusakan biota Arktik dapat mempengaruhi keseimbangan global terutama negara kepulauan termasuk Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Kedua</em>, negara-negara yang berstatus sebagai <em>observer</em> di Arctic Council memiliki ketertarikan kepentingan penelitian saintifik dan mendorong Indonesia untuk mempertimbangan menjadi <em>observer</em> yang memiliki hak istimewa yang dapat membawa kepentingan nasional Indonesia atau tidak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Ketiga</em>, pemanasan global yang menyebabkan mencairanya es di kutub utara membuka jalur baru dari Asia ke Eropa yang disebut dengan Northern Sea Route (NSR). Indonesia perlu memperhatikan rute baru ini untuk kepentingan pengembangan kekuatan maritim dan dapat mempelajari keungulan teknologi, infrastruktur, jalur pelayaran, standar pencemaran dan keselamatan pelayaran. Untuk itu Indonesia seharusnya dapat meningkatkan diplomasi maritim dengan negara-negara yang bersangkutan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Keempat</em>, kemajuan negara Arktik dalam bidang ekonomi dengan memanfaatkan sumber daya laut membuat Indonesia harus mempertimbangkan untuk menjalin hubungan lebih intensif dengan negara Arktik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Kelima</em>, Arctic Council dinilai berhasil dalam menjaga keberadaan masyarakat adat di kawasan dan mengingat Indonesia memiiki banyak masyarakat adat maka, Indonesia dapat bekerjasama untuk pemberdayaan masyarakat adat di Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/E6CkX0WrJsPkSy2t.jpg\" style=\"height:250px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://www.uarctic.org/news/2017/5/finland-announces-program-for-arctic-council-chairmanship-period/\">https://www.uarctic.org/news/2017/5/finland-announces-program-for-arctic-council-chairmanship-period/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Dari lima hasil penelitian tersebut, lalu para peneliti menyimpulkan bahwa, kawasan Arktik sangat penting dan startegis dalam isu lingkungan, perubahan iklim, perekonomian, sosial dan budaya. Namun, para peneliti menyimpulkan bahwa keterlibatan Indonesia menjadi <em>observer</em> di Arctic Council belum diperlukan hingga saat ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<strong>Tanggapan Terhadap Hasil dan Kesimpulan Penelitian</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPada prinsipnya penulis sepakat dengan hasil penelitian tersebut dan mengapriasiasi mengingat bahwa sangat sedikit dokumen resmi dan studi yang membahas persoalan di kawasan Arktik di dalam bahasa Indonesia dan relevansinya terhadap kepentingan nasional Indonesia. Namun, menurut penulis masih ada ruang kosong yang belum terakomodasi, bahkan ada kekurangan yang cukup siginifikan dan patut dipertimbangkan ulang oleh para peneliti dan pemerintah Indonesia untuk memperbaruhi perspektif dan kebijakan luar negeri Indonesia di kawasan Arktik. Penulis memiliki tiga poin tanggapan terhadap hasil dan kesimpulan penelitian ini:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Pertama</em>, produksi dan potensi minyak dan gas di kawasan Arktik adalah salah satu cadangan terbesar di dunia selain terletak di Timur Tengah seperti <em>Yamal LNG Project</em> milik Russia dan <em>Shtokman field</em> yang berada di laut Barrent yang menyimpan 3,8 triliun meter kubik (130 triliun kaki kubik). Bahkan pada tahun 2009, US Energy Information Administration mengeluarkan studi resmi dengan judul <em>Arctic Oil and Natural Gas Potential</em> yang menyebutkan bahwa kawasan Arktik memiliki 13 persen cadangan minyak dan gas dari seluruh dunia yang belum dieksplorasi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Besarnya potensi energi di kawasan Arktik harus dilihat Indonesia secara holistik sebagai alternatif sumber importir gas dan minyak (<em>energy security</em>) Indonesia yang selama ini tergantung dengan kawasan Timur Tengah yang bergejolak dan retan konfilk kawasan yang mengakibatkan harga minyak pasaran dunia tidak stabil dan mempengaruhi stabilitas ekonomi Indonesia. Potensi ini juga harus dilihat oleh Pertamina sebagai peluang kerjasama baik investasi maupun studi teknologi, dikarenakan Russia sangat membuka kerjasama dalam explorasi energi di kawasan Arktik, seperti <em>Shtokman field</em> yang belum dilakukan explorasi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Kedua</em>, <em>global warming</em> telah membuat es mencair di kawasan Arktik. Semenjak 2014 (setelah penelitian tersebut) volume pelayaran komersial di Northern Sea Route (NSR) meningkat secara signifikan sebesar 3,982 (ribu ton) dan pada 2016 menigkat lebih dari dua kali lipatnya sebesar 7,226 (ribu ton) dan pada 2030 diperkirakan akan menjadi 51,100 (ribu ton) data ini dikeluarkan resmi oleh pemerintah Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Jalur ini memiliki efesiensi waktu dan biaya yang sangat tinggi dibandingkan dengan jalur tradisional Asia ke Eropa melalui Terusan Suez yang membutuhkan waktu sekitar sebulan sedangkan, via NSR hanya butuh waktu 20 hari yang sangat menguntungkan perekonomian Indonesia dan sejalan dengan visi negara kemaritiman. Pada musim panas, kapal kargo dapat berlayar tanpa hambatan karena es mencair, sedangkan ketika musim dingin tetap bisa berlayar karena Russia telah memiliki tekonologi <em>icebreaker</em> dan pebisnis dari Indonesia dapat menjajaki kerjasama ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Ketiga</em>, Ada lima negara Asia yang tergabung sebagai <em>observer</em> di Arctic Council yaitu China, India, Jepang, Korea Selatan dan Singapura. Kehadiran negara Asia ini tidak hanya membawa kepentingan riset ilmu pengetahuan saja namun, mereka melihat potensi ekonomi yang besar dan membawa kepentingan nasional mereka di kawasan Arktik yang akan menjadi pusat perhatian politik global. Buktinya adalah pada April 2019, produsen Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), terbesar Russia Novatek menjual 20% sahamnya di Arctic LNG 2 ke pada dua perusahaan China yaitu China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Company (CNODC) dan China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) yang akan menyuplai kebutuhan energi China. Sedangkan Singapura mengincar posisi tradisionalnya sebagai negara pelabuhan yang akan dilalui jalur NSR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Usulan Terhadap Pemerintah Indonesia</strong><br />\r\nMelihat besarnya potensi di kawasan Arktik maka pemerintah harus mempertimbangkan:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Pertama</em>, melakukan studi terbaru yang fokus terhadap kepentingan nasional khususnya ekonomi. Pemerintah Indonesia membutuhkan informasi yang terbaru, koheren dan komprehensif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Kedua</em>, pemerintah Indonesia harus memberi perhatian penuh terhadap NSR, jangan sampai potensi ini akan kembali dinikmati oleh beberapa negara Asia saja, terutama adalah Singapura yang mengincar posisi tradisonalnya sebagai negara pelabuhan, padahal Indonesia memiliki potensi besar sebagai negara transit dengan potensi ekonomi yang besar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Ketiga</em>, pemerintah Indonesia harus mempertimbangkan kebijakannya di kawasan Arktik untuk menjadi pemain global dengan membawa kepentingan nasionalnya, jangan hanya menjadi penonton dan kehilangan kesempatan.<br />\r\nKeempat, pemerintah Indonesia harus mempertimbangkan untuk mengajukan diri menjadi observer di Arctic Council untuk mempermudah akes ke kawasan Arktik demi kepentingan nasional di kawasan tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/iMjGJcaRSmMJ2BaP.jpg\" style=\"height:267px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: Sandi Saputra</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Kesimpulan</strong><br />\r\nPemerintah Indonesia harus mempertimbangkan untuk mengubah kebijakan luar negerinya di kawasan Arktik menjadi lebih agresif dan memasukan menjadi kawasan strategis untuk kepenetingan nasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n---<br />\r\nPenulis adalah mahasiswa di Northern (Arctic) Federal University (NArFU) jurusan Master in Regional Studies; European Studies: Arctic Focus melalui beasiswa dari pemerintah Russia pada tahun 2018.

Bukan sesuatu yang mengherankan bagi banyak orang, mengingat Indonesia ini negara berbangsa dengan populasi islam terbesar di muka bumi. Dari &ldquo;<em>million friends zero enemy</em>&rdquo; era SBY, hingga upaya diplomasi Jokowi angkat citra islam di dalam dan luar negeri, konsepsi agama selalu jadi tempat pulang saat adu pendapat tak kunjung padam. Media sosial yang mulai ramai pada abad ke-21 menjadi perantara terdramatis, berbekal kekayaan ilmu yang manis dari para intelektualis dan mentalitas yang tak berbatas. Orang &ndash; orang tua berbincang perpolitikan di <em>facebook</em>, para anak muda mengkritisi regulasi pemerintah di <em>twitter</em>, yang ternyata semua itu berpengaruh terhadap kebijakan politik luar negeri Indonesia itu sendiri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/1tfA_WzbYH2HQkgx.jpg\" style=\"height:254px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://nalarpolitik.com/politisasi-agama/\">https://nalarpolitik.com/politisasi-agama/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nEra Sukarno hingga Megawati, posisi Islam tidak terlalu terlihat dalam agenda diplomasi luar negeri. Memang, Indonesia turut serta dalam pertemuan-pertemuan Organisasi Konferensi Islam (OKI), namun sifat partisipasinya parsial hanya sebatas pengamat. Negara - negara muslim Timur Tengah bahkan hanya minyak dan ibadah haji saja yang menggiurkan bagi Indonesia, tidak terdapat nilai religius seperti solidaritas dunia Islam dalam kebijakan &ndash; kebijakan saat itu. Siapa yang tidak tau politik luar negeri bebas aktif milik Indonesia, bebas memilih tanpa pengaruh luar sekaligus aktif bermain peran di kancah internasional. Kendati demikian, Presiden SBY mereorientasikannya ke segala arah. Sangat terlihat bagaimana Islam sangat berperan dalam menopang diplomasi Indonesia kala berinteraksi dengan dunia Internasional, lebih-lebih dunia Islam, faktor konstituen domestik dan ormas moderat di Indonesia menjadi salah satu penopang misi politik luar negeri pemerintah terutama saat merespon isu-isu kontemporer. Era SBY ini memperlihatkan bagaimana faktor intermestik dan internasional sangat menentukan arah politik luar negeri Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nTiba di era Jokowi, terlihat penguatan politik identitas Islam di tanah air, efek Jokowi dan Ahok yang sangat viral, mungkin. Sejak itu Jokowi terus berusaha mengangkat citra Islamnya di hadapan publik dalam negeri, digandrungi dengan terpilihnya Ma&rsquo;ruf Amin sebagai cawapres Jokowi dalam Pilpres 2019 mempertegas langkah tersebut. Upaya Jokowi mentransformasikan kebijakan luar negeri tertanam pada kegiatannya bersama Kuwait menyusun rancangan resolusi untuk mengutuk aksi kejam Israel. Tak hanya itu, kritikan keras juga dilayangkan kepada kebijakan AS dan Australia yang mengakui Yerusalem sebagai ibu kota Israel, sebuah langkah yang dinilai populer bagi citra pemerintahan Jokowi di dalam negeri. Presiden dua periode ini juga sangat simpati terhadap kasus pembantaian Rohingya di Myanmar. Beliau dengan serta merta menginstruksikan Menlu Retno untuk melawat ke Myanmar untuk mendesak pemerintah mereka agar menjamin segala akses organisasi kemanusiaan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDitengah kesigapan beribadah, diambang kemasyhuran toleransi, rupanya masih ada saja yang memandang minoritas sebelah mata. Isu sulitnya membangun tempat ibadah kian terjadi, persoalan yang muncul ada saja, hukum seringkali gagal dalam memecahkan seonggok masalah yang berlalu lalang.&nbsp; Dari fakta demikian, kemudian islam moderat menjadi aset Kemenlu dalam kebijakan politik luar negeri Indonesia. Hanya di Indonesia, Islam demokrasi dan <em>modernity</em> itu hidup saling berdampingan dan mendukung. Serta Dialog Lintas Agama (DLA/<em>Interfaith Dialogue</em>), sebagai salah satu program strategis dalam diplomasi Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/5BKXo1O6I7gGWFUs.jpeg\" style=\"height:511px; width:287px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Foto: Ulya Zein Wiguna</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nNamun, belum saja lepas dari konflik minoritas, ditengah proses Islamisasi kehidupan bangsa masa kini, nasionalisme Indonesia justru tampak kedodoran karena sudah lama menderita cacat berat. Indonesia tiba di sebuah persimpangan jalan seiring ketegangan menajam antara dua kiblat moralitas dan politik. Dalam praktiknya, masyarakat kian tak terhindar hadapi ancaman &ndash; ancaman dari dalam. Beragam kelompok dan kegiatan Islami bersaing keras, isu radikalisme dan terorisme kaum &ndash; kaum islam garis keras tak kunjung padam, respon masyarakat terhadap perpolitikan dalam negeri dengan mengatasnamakan agama menjadi titik perdebatan bodoh dan tidaknya para manusia di bumi.

Kebanyakan karya tentang topik itu dalam bentuk artikel jurnal, makalah konferensi, atau <em>policy paper</em> yang tidak membahas secara komprehensif. Karya-karya itu tercecer di mana-mana sehingga menyulitkan bagi publik untuk mengaksesnya. Terlebih untuk artikel jurnal yang tidak semua kalangan bisa mengaksesnya. Selain itu, karya-karya tersebut cenderung dibahas dari kacamata akademik sehingga segmen pembacanya terbatas pada kalangan akademik saja. Karena itu, buku ini saya tulis menggunakan pendekatan ilmiah namun populer sehingga siapapun dapat memahami isinya tanpa penguasaan teoritis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Kedua</em>, momentum pemilihan presiden 2019. Jauh sebelum gelaran pilpres dihelat, saya sudah berpikir untuk menulis buku tentang politik luar negeri Jokowi. Saya waktu itu berpikir karya saya ini jika diterbitkan sebelum momen pilpres 2019 tentu akan sangat relevan sebagai bahan kajian sekaligus evaluasi kebijakan luar negeri Jokowi sejak 2014-2018. Waktu itu saya berpikir seandainya Jokowi kalah, paling tidak buku ini bisa menjadi semacam catatan bagaimana sepak-terjang diplomasi Jokowi selama empat tahun pemerintahannya. Ini tentu akan menjadi bahan masukan bagi pemerintahan selanjutnya. Namun jika ternyata Jokowi menang, buku ini tetap relevan untuk memberikan masukan apa saja yang harus dilakukan pemerintahan Jokowi di periode kedua kekuasaannya. Ternyata, seperti kita lihat bersama, Jokowi kembali menjadi presiden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<em><strong>HI.id: Bagaimana pendapat anda tentang Poros Maritim Dunia (PMD) sebagai agenda politik luar negeri Indonesia dalam konteks politik internasional di abad 21 ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">M.R: Gagasan PMD sejatinya bukan berasal dari Jokowi. Kita sama-sama tahu Jokowi bukanlah seorang pemimpin negara yang punya wawasan internasional. <em>Concern</em> Jokowi hanyalah lingkup domestik. Sehingga dengan demikian ia membutuhkan masukan dari para ahli hubungan internasional terkait bagaimana desain politik luar negeri Indonesia. Rizal Sukma tak ayal adalah arsitek politik luar negeri Jokowi di periode pertamanya. Gagasan PMD sangat kontekstual dengan gagasan &lsquo;<em>post-ASEAN foreign policy</em>&rsquo; dan &lsquo;Indo-Pasifik&rsquo; dari Sukma. Gagasan PMD sebenarnya amat penting paling tidak karena dua alasan. <em>Pertama</em>, gagasan ini sering dikaitkan dengan identitas Indonesia sebagai negara kepulauan (<em>archipelagic state</em>). Dalam politik luar negeri, identitas suatu negara sangat penting untuk mendefinisikan kepentingan nasional apa yang hendak dikejar Indonesia. Artinya, gagasan PMD memberikan landasan konseptual ke mana kebijakan luar negeri Indonesia akan dibawa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Kedua</em>, gagasan ini relevan dengan paradigma hubungan internasional abad-21 dimana kontestasi politik antarnegara akan lebih banyak berkenaan dengan isu maritim. Kebangkitan Tiongkok yang diiringi dengan kebijakan asertifnya di Laut Cina Selatan serta strategi besar <em>One Belt One Road</em> (OBOR) yang memicu rivalitas antarnegara besar merupakan konteks geopolitik betapa strategisnya isu maritim dalam hubungan antarnegara. Dengan latar belakang itu, jelas gagasan PMD sangat penting. Sayangnya, diskursus PMD justru hilang di periode kedua pemerintahan Jokowi. PMD ibarat balon yang setelah ditiup dengan cepat mengempis. PMD pada akhirnya hanya sebatas retorika tanpa strategi kebijakan yang jelas dan terarah. Pemerintahan Jokowi nampaknya lebih berkonsentrasi pada isu-isu lain di level domestik. Ini sekaligus menguatkan asumsi bahwa gagasan PMD bukan berasal dari Jokowi. Kalau dari Jokowi, tentu tidak dengan mudah lenyap dari narasi politik Jokowi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>HI.id: Bagaimana pendapat anda tentang langkah Indonesia yang sedikit mengambil jarak terkait perannya di ASEAN dalam beberapa tahun belakangan ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">M.R: Perlu digarisbawahi bahwa corak kebijakan luar negeri Jokowi sangat mencerminkan karakter personalnya. Jokowi pada dasarnya tidak begitu tertarik dengan forum multilateral karena dianggap bertele-tele, penuh perdebatan, dan tidak membawa hasil konkret. Jokowi lebih senang menggunakan pendekatan bilateral yang lebih terfokus dan hasilnya konkret. Pragmatisme Jokowi membuat ASEAN dianggap forum yang kurang &lsquo;bermanfaat&rsquo; bagi kepentingan nasional Indonesia. Jika kemudian pemerintah menyangkal anggapan ini, saya sepakat bahwa Indonesia pada kenyataannya tidak berpaling dari ASEAN. Indonesia faktanya masih konsisten mengikuti setiap pertemuan ASEAN, bahkan menjadi tuan rumah di beberapa event ASEAN. Akan tetapi, saya berargumen bahwa keterlibatan ini sebatas formalitas belaka, semata-mata karena Indonesia adalah <em>primus inter pares</em> di kawasan. Selain itu, selama ini sudah terlanjur menjadi kredo di Kementerian Luar Negeri bahwa ASEAN adalah sokoguru kebijakan luar negeri Indonesia. Alhasil, betapapun Indonesia memandang ASEAN tidak penting Indonesia tetap harus tampil dan terlibat di ASEAN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pendek kata, Indonesia tidak bisa melepaskan diri dari ASEAN semata-mata karena produk sejarah. Kita bisa mengamati bahwa sikap Jokowi terhadap ASEAN cenderung berbeda dari pendahulu-pendahulunya. Sekali lagi ini semata-mata karena karakter personal Jokowi yang pragmatis. Di mata Jokowi, ASEAN menempati prioritas ke sekian dibandingkan, misalnya, mengundang sebanyak-banyaknya investasi asing dan kerjasama ekonomi dengan negara mitra. Pola pikir Jokowi sangat sederhana; diplomasi haruslah menghasilkan keuntungan (materi) buat Indonesia. Karena ASEAN tidak menjanjikan hal semacam itu (dalam jangka pendek), maka Indonesia agak menjaga jarak dari ASEAN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>HI.id: Salah satu tantangan yang dihadapi oleh negara-negara di Asia Tenggara maupun di dunia internasional adalah kebangkitan Tiongkok. Menurut pendapat anda bagaimana Indonesia hendaknya menyikapi hal ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">M.R: Kebangkitan Tiongkok menurut pendapat saya adalah faktor penggerak struktur internasional abad-21. Seluruh kekuatan dunia yang ada sekarang ini berkonsentrasi pada bagaimana menghadapi kebangkitan Tiongkok. Kebangkitan Tiongkok ibarat pedang bermata dua; di satu sisi membawa peluang namun di saat bersamaan membawa tantangan. Setiap negara seringkali menghadapi dilema ketika mencoba melakukan penyesuaian terhadap kebangkitan Tiongkok. Tak terkecuali Indonesia. Untungnya, Indonesia memiliki &lsquo;sabuk pengaman&rsquo; berupa prinsip bebas-aktif yang menjaga Indonesia tetap konsisten untuk tidak terlalu condong ke salah satu kutub kekuatan dunia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pada era Jokowi, kita melihat kecondongan Indonesia kepada Tiongkok. Namun jangan ditafsirkan kecondongan itu sebagai upaya &lsquo;mengekor&rsquo;. Indonesia menurut hemat saya hanya berusaha memanfaatkan kebangkitan Tiongkok untuk mendapatkan keuntungan. Di tengah agenda pemerintahan Jokowi yang ingin merestrukturisasi perekonomian nasional, kebangkitan Tiongkok &ndash; terutama dengan OBOR-nya &ndash; seolah-olah membawa angin surga bagi Indonesia untuk mengejar ketertinggalan. Dalam konteks ekonomi saat ini, Tiongkok boleh jadi merupakan mitra ekonomi terpenting bagi Indonesia. Tidak ada yang salah dengan itu asalkan Indonesia tetap berhati-hati (<em>prudent</em>) supaya tidak mengorbankan kepentingan nasional. Di sisi lain, kebangkitan Tiongkok juga menciptakan potensi ancaman dalam konteks keamanan regional. Hal ini terutama dikaitkan dengan isu Laut Cina Selatan dimana Tiongkok selama ini begitu agresif menekan ASEAN walaupun Tiongkok termasuk negara besar yang cukup akomodatif jika diajak bernegosiasi. Kasus insiden di perairan Natuna silam cukup memberikan bukti bahwa Indonesia tidak berkompromi soal kedaulatan. Jadi kesimpulannya, Indonesia harus bekerjasama dengan Tiongkok dalam bidang ekonomi namun tetap teguh pada prinsip ketika menyangkut keamanan nasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>HI.id: Apa rekomendasi yang hendak anda sampaikan melalui buku ini terkait strategi politik luar negeri Indonesia ke depannya?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">M.R: Seperti sudah saya tulis di buku saya, ada empat rekomendasi yang bisa saya sampaikan kepada pemerintahan Jokowi di periode kedua pemerintahannya dalam konteks kebijakan luar negeri. <em>Pertama</em>, orientasi kebijakan luar negeri Indonesia ke depan harus lebih <em>outward looking</em>. Selama periode pertama pemerintahannya, Jokowi sudah cukup memfokuskan pada level domestik. Kini saatnya Indonesia lebih aktif lagi di pentas politik global. Dari slogan &lsquo;<em>foreign policy begins at home</em>&rsquo; ke &lsquo;<em>foreign policy from home to the world</em>&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/Ca5TJLvsO72W8tdP.jpg\" style=\"height:350px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: Mohammad Rosyidin</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Kedua</em>, Indonesia ke depan harus lebih aktif di dalam forum-forum multilateral. Pragmatisme Jokowi hendaknya tidak lagi menjadi satu-satunya prinsip hubungan luar negeri. Walau bagaimanapun, multilateralisme itu penting. Peningkatan pengaruh internasional Indonesia bisa ditempuh melalui forum-forum multilateral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Ketiga</em>, Indonesia tidak boleh berpaling dari ASEAN. Konsep &lsquo;Indo-Pasifik&rsquo; yang diusung Jokowi pada KTT ASEAN di Bangkok pada Juni 2019 kemarin patut diapresiasi. Tinggal bagaimana Indonesia berkomitmen pada <em>outlook</em> tersebut. Yang paling penting, konsep Indo-Pasifik jangan hanya direduksi sebatas kerjasama infrastrktur dan hal-hal yang sangat inward-looking. Indo-Pasifik harus dimaknai sebagai perluasan peran ASEAN sebagai &lsquo;kekuatan transformatif&rsquo; &ndash; meminjam istilah Marty Natalegawa &ndash; yang merangkul negara-negara besar dan meredam rivalitas di antara mereka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Keempat</em>, perlu ada redefinisi konsep kepentingan nasional. Selama ini Jokowi menafsirkan kepentingan nasional sebatas keuntungan materiil &ndash; ekonomi. Padahal, kepentingan nasional maknanya sangat luas. Salah satunya, kepentingan Indonesia sebagai &lsquo;anggota komunitas internasional&rsquo; yang turut memikul tanggung jawab dalam menyelesaikan permasalahan-permasalahan global. Dalam konteks ini, kepentingan nasional menyangkut hal-hal yang lebih bersifat ideasional. Penting dipahami bahwa kepentingan ini bukanlah bentuk altruisme Indonesia melainkan amanat konstitusi bahwa Indonesia wajib &ldquo;ikut melaksanakan ketertiban dunia yang berdasarkan kemerdekaan, perdamaian abadi dan keadilan sosial.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>HI.id: Terima kasih atas kebersediaannya dalam menjawab pertanyaan kami.

(40,25,1,'Indonesia Sebagai Middle Power - Perlucutan Senjata Nuklir dan Komitmen Politik Luar Negeri','',NULL,'<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Penulis: Arif Sulistio Budi (Mahasiswa Hubungan Internasional Universitas Sebelas Maret)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Editor: Virtuous Setyaka</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPada bulan Juni 2019, Indonesia mengirimkan Delegasi ke Swedia tepatnya di Kota Stockholm untuk menghadiri Pertemuan Tingkat Menteri dalam pembahasannya mengenai Perlucutan Senjata Nuklir dan Traktat Non-Proliferasi Senjata Nuklir. Sebagaimana telah diketahui sebelumnya bahwa dalam isu ini Indonesia menegaskan posisinya sebagai salah satu aktor Gerakan Non Blok (GNB) yang aktif. Mengingat status Indonesia sebagai salah satu negara yang tidak memegang kendali atas hak kepemilikan senjata nuklir (Non-Nuclear Weapon States/NNWS), sepak terjang Indonesia dalam memainkan peranan negara &ldquo;penengah&rdquo; dalam urusan perlucutan senjata pemusnah massal sudah tidak diragukan lagi. Sejak tahun 1994, Indonesia sudah mengemban misi internasional sebagai Koordinator Kelompok Kerja (Pokja) Perlucutan Senjata GNB yang dipraktikkan melalui wadah kerjasama multilateral. Dalam kondisi terbaru saat ini, Indonesia dapat dikatakan mendapat kepercayaan yang cukup kuat untuk menjadi <em>bridge builder</em> mengingat kompetensi dan konsistensi untuk menjalankan Politik Luar Negeri Bebas Aktif. Hal ini salah satunya dibuktikan dengan prestasi Indonesia dalam pertemuan <em>Nuclear Security Summit</em> (NSS) 2010-2016 dengan menawarkan model penyusunan peraturan mengenai keamanan nuklir agar dapat memudahkan koordinasi antar negara dalam pembuatan keputusan di masa depan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nIndonesia dan gagasan perlucutan nuklir tentu saja tidak terlepas dari cita-cita luhur bangsa Indonesia yang tertuang dalam konstitusi UUD 1945. Tugas memelihara ketertiban dan perdamaian dunia menjadi senjata pamungkas untuk melegitimasi gaya politik luar negeri yang netral. Gaung agenda pembahasan isu perlucutan nuklir sebagai salah satu program Kemenlu RI tidak hanya berdiri sendiri, beberapa waktu lalu tepatnya pada 2 Juli 2019 pihak Indonesia dan Jerman mengadakan <em>Round Table Discussion</em> (RTD) dengan tema <em>Advancing Peace Diplomacy and Supporting Nuclear Disarmament Agenda</em> di Lemhannas RI untuk membahas isu perlucutan nuklir. Dari pertemuan tersebut menandakan Indonesia juga telah sebelumnya menggunakan kesempatan multilateralisme sebagai perangkat dukungan dalam mencapai agenda politik luar negeri dan kontribusinya di bidang keamanan internasional, yaitu forum Dewan Keamanan PBB. Secara garis besar dan sejauh pengamatan penulis selama menjalankan fungsi notulen di acara tersebut, RTD bertujuan untuk membahas isu nuklir berdasarkan kondisi terkini berupa hubungan yang memburuk antara Amerika Serikat dan Iran, ekspansi Rusia dan bangkitnya kekuatan Republik Rakyat Tiongkok (RRT).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/TQoFkh0rkZ64oZ2p.png\" style=\"height:206px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Image</em>:<a href=\"http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/strategies-for-middle-powers/\"> http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/strategies-for-middle-powers/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nIsu mengenai perlucutan senjata nuklir dan upaya perdamaian global menjadi agenda bersama bagi kedua negara (Indonesia dan Jerman) mengingat posisi Indonesia yang saat ini merupakan Anggota Tidak Tetap Dewan Keamanan PBB periode 2019-2020, di mana salah satu anggotanya adalah Jerman. Tidaklah menutup kemungkinan apabila Jerman menunjukkan intensi pendekatan terhadap Indonesia yang salah satunya dicerminkan pada pelaksanaan RTD tersebut. Bagaimanapun para mantan perwira tinggi yang sebagian diantaranya pernah bertugas untuk NATO turut menegaskan bahwa Jerman juga berusaha mengambil jalan tengah mengenai persoalan nuklir mengingat kawasannya (Eropa) saat ini sedang tidak stabil akibat persaingan NATO dengan Rusia. Indonesia pun demikian, mengambil inisiatif untuk mendorong Perlucutan senjata nuklir bersamaan dengan negara seperti Jerman ialah demi menjamin keamanan negara di kawasan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nKeamanan yang dimaksud Indonesia ialah mengambil keuntungan geopolitik dari stabilitas perdamaian global oleh karena berkurangnya penggunaan nuklir sebagai instrumen persenjataan. Hal tersebut didasarkan pada fakta maraknya globalisasi dan berakhirnya Perang Dingin yang membuat proliferasi nuklir meningkat bersamaan dengan kemudahan akses ilmu pengetahuan mengenai pengembangan nuklir dari bahan uranium dan plutonium. Indonesia berusaha untuk mengamankan posisinya sebagai negara non pemilik nuklir dari ancaman dan dinamika konflik global terutama oleh negara-negara pemegang hak dan pemilik senjata nuklir (Nuclear Weapon States/NWS). Tidak menutup kemungkinan bahwa nuklir dapat digunakan sebagai alat <em>deterrence</em> oleh negara manapun. Hal tersebut membuat negara-negara yang prihatin akan isu proliferasi senjata nuklir untuk terus menyuarakan gagasannya yang berupa pencegahan ploriferasi bahan-bahan yang tidak terpantau dan sekaligus senjata nuklir. Oleh sebab itu, dapat dikatakan pula situasi politik global saat ini dijadikan oleh Indonesia sebagai salah satu ajang mengejar cita-cita konstitusi UUD 1945 yaitu mewujudkan perdamaian abadi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSelain karena alasan keamanan, sikap Indonesia yang turut terlibat dalam isu perlucutan nuklir merupakan salah satu strategi yang disebut sebagai <em>middle power</em>. Istilah <em>middle power</em> merupakan konsep yang dapat menjelaskan aktivisme negara-negara <em>second tier</em> dalam hierarki dunia dalam hal ini Indonesia juga termasuk didalamnya. Sejalan dengan pendekatan Emmers dan Teo, Indonesia yang dikategorikan sebagai <em>middle power</em> didasarkan pada rendahnya ancaman keamanan kawasan serta keterbatasan sumber daya nasional sebagai sebuah negara berkembang. Karakteristik dasar bagi Indonesia yang merupakan salah satu dari <em>middle power</em> ialah bersikap fleksibel dan memanfaatkan momentum termasuk dalam pelaksanaan politik luar negeri. Dalam kasus keterlibatan isu perlucutan senjata nuklir, Indonesia memanfaatkan momentumnya sebagai anggota tidak tetap DK PBB. Sebagai sebuah negara <em>middle power</em>, Indonesia memiliki kehendak untuk dapat berperan optimal dalam teater politik internasional secara <em>low hanging fruit</em>. Meningkatnya peranan Indonesia di forum internasional terutama isu perlucutan nuklir seharusnya dapat meningkatkan kredibilitas bangsa di mata dunia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/AU3Foj-V-ya1UbAS.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Foto: Arif Sulilstio Budi</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nLangkah Indonesia sebagai <em>middle power</em> ini dilakukan dengan cara menampilkan diri sebagai entitas nasional yang tidak menentang kehendak standar ganda negara-negara besar pemilik nuklir (<em>big five</em>). Indonesia tidak berniat melakukan perlucutan senjata nuklir (secara paksa) yang telah dimiliki sebelumnya oleh negara-negara <em>superpower </em>maupun beberapa negara di luar lingkaran <em>big five</em>. Menyadari bahwa standar ganda yang diterapkan oleh<em> big five</em> menjadi hambatan utama bagi negara-negara non pemilik persenjataan nuklir termasuk Indonesia. Oleh sebab itu, Indonesia memainkan peranan untuk mendorong perlucutan senjata nuklir dengan tidak melihatnya sebagai fungsi persenjataan semata melainkan melakukan inisiatif perlucutan dengan menggeser sifat nuklir dari eksistensi awalnya sebagai senjata menjadi sebuah perangkat lain yang lebih berguna. Dengan kata lain, Indonesia menempatkan ide perlucutan senjata nuklir sebagai gagasan untuk mendapatkan legitimasi internasional dan mengajak negara-negara lain untuk turut serta mendukung sekaligus membawa gagasan untuk mengalihkan fungsi senjata nuklir menjadi seperti misalnya sumber daya energi untuk kesejahteraan masyarakat global. Dengan cara itu, Indonesia berperan tegas menolak pengayaan uranium nuklir tujuan yang destruktif dan sebaliknya nuklir dan segala hal yang berkaitan dengannya seharusnya diberdayakan secara multiguna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n','','Politik, Internasional, Indonesia, Power, Senjata','012020',2,1,830,NULL,1579496400,1579530962,1607058132,1,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,842),

Persepsi tentang ancaman tentunya berbeda-beda, meski demikian pemerintah dengan mengatasnamakan masyarakat maupun masyarakat mengatasnamakan diri mereka sendiri bisa melakukan identifikasi dan klasifikasi hal yang dianggap sebagai ancaman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDalam konteks perlindungan terhadap warga negara di dalam negeri, hal ini sudah sering kita lihat. Sebut saja kehadiran negara dalam memberikan perlindungan kepada masyarakat ketika terjadi musibah, menjaga stabilitas bahan pangan, menjaga keamanan ataupun ancaman dan lain sebagainya. Semua kegiatan tersebut adalah beberapa contoh dari perlindungan negara terhadap warga negaranya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAkan tetapi, dalam konteks kehidupan warga negara di luar negeri, keinginan negara untuk hadir dan melindungi warga negaranya menjadi sesuatu permasalahan yang pelik karena berbenturan dengan kedaulatan negara lain. Terlebih jika ada kondisi tertentu lainnya yang menyulitkan proses pemberian perlindungan maupun pemulangan warga negaranya seperti terjadinya perang ataupun kondisi lainnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDari dalam negeri, respon masyarakat atas pemulangan Warga Negara Indonesia (WNI) yang berada di luar negeri pun bisa berbeda. Seperti halnya dalam dua kejadian yang baru-baru ini terjadi. Pemulangan WNI dari Wuhan dan isu pemulangan WNI eks ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) mendapatkan tantangan dan respon yang berbeda dari segi pemerintah maupun masyarakat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artikel ini dibuat untuk memberikan analisis singkat terhadap keputusan negara dalam wacana WNI dari Wuhan dan memulangkan WNI eks-ISIS. Mengapa negara mengambil sikap yang berbeda dalam hal ini?<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Perlindungan Negara pada Upaya Pemulangan WNI dari Wuhan</strong><br />\r\nKeputusan Pemerintah Indonesia dalam memulangkan WNI dari Wuhan merupakan bentuk tanggung jawab negara dalam upaya memberikan perlindungan terhadap warga negaranya yang sedang terancam di luar sana. Upaya pemulangan ini berjalan lancar selain karena <a href=\"https://regional.kompas.com/read/2020/02/02/09090061/skenario-pemulangan-wni-dari-wuhan-diperiksa-di-batam-dikarantina-2-minggu?page=all\">kesiapan</a> rencana penjemputan juga dikarenakan sikap kooperatif negara tujuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAkan tetapi, upaya ini mendapatkan tantangan tersendiri ketika WNI yang dievakuasi sampai ke Indonesia. Keputusan negara memilih lokasi karantina dari WNI yang dipulangkan di wilayah Natuna mendapatkan respon dari masyarakat setempat. Gencarnya isu yang beredar tentang penyebaran serta dampak dari virus Corona membuat masyarakat Natuna menjadi resah. Masyarakat di Natuna merasa keberatan atas ancaman yang didatangkan ke wilayah mereka. Bentuk keberatan tersebut diwujudkan dalam demonstrasi bahkan sampai <a href=\"https://www.vivanews.com/berita/nasional/34492-video-warga-natuna-eksodus-keluar-pulau-gara-gara-corona?medium=autonext\">eksodus</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPada kasus ini, pemerintah terlihat dengan jelas siap menanggung resiko dari pemulangan WNI meski saat itu belum diketahui secara pasti apakah ada di antara WNI yang dipulangkan terjangkit virus Corona atau tidak? Pemulangan ini tidak hanya menunjukkan kehadiran negara dalam memberikan perlindungan kepada WNI di luar sana tetapi juga seolah menunjukkan bahwa negara siap dengan segala resiko yang mungkin terjadi dari langkah yang diambilnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebagai pembanding, negara lain juga ikut memulangkan warga negaranya dari Wuhan yang terancam oleh virus Corona. Negara-negara <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/europe-evacuates-citizens-from-china-russia-shuts-border-1.4790018\">Eropa</a> seperti Perancis dan Inggris, ataupun negara seperti <a href=\"https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/evacuation-of-americans-from-wuhan-china/\">Amerika Serikat</a> juga ikut memulangkan warga negaranya sebagai bentuk perlindungan negara kepada warga negaranya dari ancaman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Perlindungan Negara pada Upaya Pemulangan WNI Eks ISIS</strong><br />\r\nHal yang berbeda terjadi pada (wacana) pemulangan WNI eks ISIS yang beberapa waktu lalu. Wacana ini pada akhirnya harus gugur karena pemerintah tidak bersedia memulangkan kembali WNI eks ISIS. Bahkan status mereka tidak lagi dianggap sebagai WNI. Mengapa demikian? Ada dua hal penting yang harus disoroti dari wacana pemulangan WNI eks ISIS ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em>Pertama</em>, ancaman ideologi yang datang seandainya pemulangan tersebut benar terjadi. Keberadaannya tidak hanya menjadi ancaman bagi masyarakat tetapi juga bagi ideologi negara. Melalui kaca mata negara, ancaman terhadap ideologi ini dianggap sebagai salah satu ancaman terhadap nilai-nilai fundamental yang diadopsi oleh negara. Hal ini lebih lanjut akan berdampak pada tatanan hidup masyarakat yang meliputi sosial, ekonomi maupun politik. Pada tahap ekstrim, pergantian ideologi negara dapat dianggap seperti mendirikan sebuah negara baru.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em>Kedua</em>, status WNI yang dianggap sudah tidak berlaku lagi. Selain bergabung dengan ISIS, kelompok masyarakat ini juga membakar paspor mereka. Hal ini seolah mengukuhkan posisi mereka yang tidak berniat mengakui Indonesia sebagai negaranya. Atas dasar itulah kemudian Indonesia mencabut status kewarganegaraan mereka. Negara dapat mencabut status kewarganegaraan dari seseorang berdasarkan kondisi tertentu. Apabila hal ini terjadi, maka orang tersebut menjadi berstatus <em>stateless</em> atau tanpa kewarganegaraan. Kewajiban Indonesia dalam memberikan perlindungan dari segala bentuk ancaman yang datang kepada orang tersebut menjadi hilang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/oGrvW-ghyDYEA3PF.jpg\" style=\"height:212px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://spherestandards.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Humanitarian-Charter-cartoons-3.jpg\">https://spherestandards.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Humanitarian-Charter-cartoons-3.jpg</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kondisi ini menimbulkan pro dan kontra di kalangan masyarakat. Ada yang sepakat dengan keputusan pemerintah ada pula yang masih berharap pemerintah bersedia memulangkan mereka atas dasar kemanusiaan terlebih eks ISIS yang statusnya masih <a href=\"https://tirto.id/mengapa-jokowi-perlu-pulangkan-anak-anak-wni-eks-isis-ezAq\">anak-anak</a>. Apapun itu, Indonesia menunjukkan bahwa tidak mau mengambil resiko dari pemulangan eks ISIS. Berbeda dengan pemulangan WNI dari Wuhan, pemerintah tampaknya tidak percaya diri untuk mengambil resiko dari pemulangan eks ISIS. Apakah ini sebagai bentuk ketidakpercayaan pemerintah terhadap program deradikalisasi untuk menetralisir ideologi radikal pada warga negaranya? Atau sekedar mengikuti tindakan dari negara lain yang juga tidak mau memulangkan warga negaranya yang bergabung dengan ISIS?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebagai pembanding, pencabutan status kewarganegaraan yang kemudian dilanjutkan dengan penolakan untuk memulangkan kembali warga negaranya yang bergabung dengan ISIS tidak hanya terjadi di Indonesia saja. Negara lain seperti <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c929f90-3e6b-11e9-9bee-efab61506f44\">Jerman</a> juga secara terang-terangan mencabut status kewarganegaraan ganda yang dimiliki oleh warga negaranya yang ikut berperang bersama ISIS. Meski masih mempertimbangkan status anak-anak yang hanya mengikuti orang tuanya bergabung dengan ISIS, wacana yang hampir sama juga mendapatkan pertentangan di <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/world/europe/isis-children-belgium.html\">Perancis dan Belgia</a>. Negara Eropa lain seperti <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/12/10/783369673/europe-remains-reluctant-to-repatriate-its-isis-fighters-here-s-why\">Inggris dan Denmark</a> pun ikut mencabut status kewarganegaraan warga negaranya yang ikut bergabung bersama ISIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Analogi sederhana Pemulangan WNI dari Wuhan dan WNI eks ISIS</strong><br />\r\nBerdasarkan penjelasan di atas sebelumnya mungkin beberapa pembaca sudah memiliki gambaran perbedaan dari dua kasus pemulangan WNI ini. Akan tetapi melalui tulisan ini saya mencoba untuk membuat sebuah analogi sederhana agar masyarakat bisa memahami lebih baik perbedaannya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jika negara diibaratkan sebagai sebuah rumah dengan Presiden sebagai kepala rumah tangganya, maka warga negara adalah anak-anak yang mendiami rumah tersebut. WNI yang berada di luar negeri ibarat anak yang sedang main/bertamu/bekerja di rumah orang lain. Meski sedang tidak berada di rumah, kepala rumah tangga tetap berkewajiban untuk menjaga dan melindungi anaknya yang sedang berada di luar karena ikatan dari hubungan yang masih ada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBerbeda halnya jika ikatan antara anak dan rumahnya terputus. Kepala rumah tangga tidak lagi berkewajiban memberikan perlindungan kepada anak yang status ikatannya dengan rumah sudah putus. Masalah si anak akan mendapatkan rumah baru atau bagaimana nasibnya, bukan menjadi tanggung jawab rumah asal untuk melindunginya. Memulangkannya malah bisa mendapatkan pertanyaan dari anak lainnya tentang komitmen untuk tetap berada dalam satu atap rumah yang sama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/ePlzRnWpyFtfLjSE.png\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/4060822/broken_flown_kite_rope_string_toy_icon\">https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/4060822/broken_flown_kite_rope_string_toy_icon</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAnalogi lain yang saya coba gunakan untuk menjelaskan ini adalah analogi bermain layangan. Ketika benang masih utuh dan terikat kuat pada pegangannya maka sejauh apapun layangan tersebut terbang masih tetap bisa didaratkan dengan cara digulung benangnya. Akan tetapi ketika benang tersebut putus, maka konsekuensinya adalah layangan akan terjatuh tak menentu arah. Apakah pemain layangan akan mengejar layangannya yang terputus dengan resikonya? Atau membiarkannya untuk diambil oleh orang lain? Mengapa tidak bikin saja layangan lainnya?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Akhir Kata</strong><br />\r\nPemerintah Indonesia sejauh ini telah menunjukkan upaya untuk kembali hadir untuk masyarakat termasuk yang berada di luar negeri. Pada beberapa kasus lainnya seperti Tenaga Kerja Indonesia (TKI) yang terancam hukuman <a href=\"https://www.cnnindonesia.com/internasional/20181025122344-106-341340/empat-tahun-jokowi-443-wni-bebas-dari-hukuman-mati\">mati</a>, pemerintah Indonesia juga terlihat telah <a href=\"https://news.detik.com/berita/d-3929464/tki-dihukum-pancung-di-saudi-perlindungan-tki-terus-diperkuat\">aktif</a> untuk memberikan pendampingan kepada rakyatnya. Tidak sampai di situ, Indonesia juga membuka dirinya dari para <a href=\"https://www.merdeka.com/dunia/badan-pbb-puji-cara-indonesia-tangani-pengungsi-internasional.html\">pengungsi</a>.

Momen ini penting sebagai bahan refleksi kritis kita sebagai insan akademik HI di Indonesia; kira-kira apa yang sudah dicapai ilmu HI di Indonesia serta bagaimana prospek ilmu HI ke depan. Di Indonesia sendiri, saya melihat kurangnya gairah para akademisi HI untuk menulis karya dalam rangka memperingati seabad ilmu HI. Saya melihat kekosongan literatur di luar buku-buku ajar standar yang sudah banyak bermunculan belakangan ini. Jarang sekali saya melihat ada karya yang mencoba mengomentasi atau melakukan telaah kritis terhadap perkembangan studi HI kontemporer. Kekosongan literatur inilah yang kami coba isi melalui karya ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/G9hRS46eaaSPqRv1.jpg\" style=\"height:440px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(hi.id): bagaimana anda melihat sejarah munculnya studi Hubungan Internasional?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(M.R): Di awal kemunculannya, ilmu HI itu didirikan dengan tujuan yang amat mulia yaitu mencegah perang antarnegara. Atau bahasa sederhananya ilmu untuk menciptakan perdamaian dunia. Tujuan yang sekarang menjadi bahan tertawaan saja sebab secanggih apapun ilmu HI memberikan analisisnya, toh perang tak bisa dicegah. Sebuah perdebatan abadi antara realis dan liberalis. Namun terlepas dari hal itu, kelahiran ilmu HI setidaknya mencerminkan dua hal. Pertama, ilmu HI bersifat ideologis karena dipengaruhi oleh prinsip-prinsip liberalisme. Upaya mewujudkan perdamaian dunia karena trauma akan Perang Dunia I jelas mencerminkan visi liberal. Jika Woodrow Wilson berupaya mendamaikan dunia lewat jalur organisasi internasional (Liga Bangsa Bangsa) maka ilmu HI mendamaikan dunia lewat jalur riset ilmiah. Kedua, ilmu HI sangat bias karena kelahirannya dibidani oleh negara Barat (AS dan Inggris). Ilmu HI pada mulanya adalah &lsquo;ilmu Barat&rsquo; yang kemudian diadopsi oleh masyarakat dunia menjadi seolah-olah universal. Karena lahir dari peradaban Barat, tak heran apabila teori-teori dan konsep-konsep yang muncul di kemudian hari sangat dipengaruhi oleh pengalaman Barat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(hi.id): Ada tiga great debate dalam studi Hubungan Internasional. Menurut anda apa kontribusi dari tiga great debate tersebut terhadap perkembangan studi Hubungan Internasional kontemporer saat ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(M.R): Dari ketiga debat HI, debat ketiga (positivisme vs pospositivisme) saya kira yang paling berpengaruh. Hal ini lantaran debat ini menyasar isu epistemologi dan metodologi HI. Penganut positivisme menuntut HI mengadopsi cara-cara ilmu alam supaya derajatnya &lsquo;ilmiah&rsquo;. Sebaliknya, penganut pospositivisme menganggap ilmu HI sebagai bagian dari ilmu sosial-humaniora tidak bisa dipelajari serupa dengan cara kerja ilmu alam. Kubu pospositivis menyodorkan metode penafsiran yang dipandang lebih sesuai dibanding model hubungan sebab-akibat yang ditawarkan kaum positivis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hingga kini, perdebatan kedua perspektif tetap sulit didamaikan. Namun harus diakui bahwa sependek pengetahuan saya, pendekatan positivis boleh dikatakan lebih unggul dibanding pendekatan pospositivis dalam hal kontribusinya bagi studi HI kontemporer. Buktinya, mayoritas karya akademik HI mengadopsi pendekatan positivis. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa pospositivisme belum cukup berhasil dalam menarik minat ilmuwan HI untuk menggunakan model analisis mereka. Belum lagi secara teknis pendekatan pospositivis yang relatif lebih &lsquo;sulit&rsquo; dibanding positivis yang lebih sederhana. Meski demikian, perspektif pospositivisme telah memberikan nuansa berbeda dalam memahami HI, tidak melulu berkutat pada terminologi &lsquo;faktor penyebab&rsquo; melainkan interpretasi yang lebih beragam dan kreatif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(hi.id): Di dalam buku ini anda turut membahas masalah Teori Hubungan Internasional non-barat di Indonesia. Tolong jelaskan mengapa diskursus ini muncul dalam studi Hubungan Internasional? Dan bagaimana menurut anda prospek pendekatan non-barat ini ke depannya?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(M.R): Teori HI non-Barat muncul sebagai debat akademik ketika Amitav Acharya dan Barry Buzan menulis artikel tahun 2007 dengan judul &ldquo;<em>why is there no non-western IR theory</em>?&rdquo; Pertanyaan ini penting karena menggugah kesadaran kita sebagai insan HI non-Barat bahwa selama ini kita hanya mengonsumsi teori-teori HI Barat tanpa menyumbangkan sedikitpun pemikiran di luar arus utama. Pertanyaan itu sekaligus menjadi bahan interospeksi kira-kira apa sebabnya masyarakat non-Barat tidak mampu melahirkan teori-teori HI versi mereka sendiri. Di buku ini, saya beranggapan bahwa perspektif poskolonialisme relevan untuk menjawab pertanyaan itu. Meminjam konsep Syed Farid Alatas, faktor utama tumpulnya kreatifitas akademisi non-Barat untuk mencetuskan teori mereka sendiri adalah &lsquo;benak terbelenggu&rsquo; (<em>captive mind</em>), yakni sebuah kondisi dimana pola pikir yang memandang teori-teori Barat begitu adiluhung dan memadai untuk menjelaskan realitas non-Barat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sindrom benak terbelenggu ini menumpulkan daya kritis terhadap pemikiran Barat sehingga mudah bagi kita sebagai masyarakat non-Barat merepetisi, mereplikasi, dan mereproduksi gagasan-gagasan Barat. Padahal, kalau kita mau menengok ke dalam, Indonesia punya banyak sumber inspirasi guna merumuskan perspektif kita sendiri. Menurut Qin Yaqing, budaya merupakan bahan baku utama dalam upaya teorisasi HI. mengapa budaya? Sebab budaya menyediakan cara pandang masyarakat tentang dunia (<em>worldview</em>). Aneka ragam budaya Indonesia sebenarnya cukup potensial diangkat di tingkat global dalam bentuk pemikiran tentang HI. Budaya Jawa contohnya, sudah diteliti oleh banyak Indonesianis asing. Hanya saja, akademisi HI amat jarang menggunakan hasil-hasil riset itu untuk merumuskan teori HI. Selain itu, faktor sejarah juga penting bagi teorisasi HI non-Barat. Sebagai negara bekas jajahan, sejarah Indonesia tentu kontras dengan Barat sebagai penjajah. Pengalaman sejarah ini penting untuk mengidentifikasi bagaimana Indonesia memandang dunia. Jadi, persoalannya bukan apakah kita mempunyai &lsquo;bahan baku&rsquo; teori HI non-Barat melainkan maukah kita mendobrak kekakuan berpikir yang selalu berkiblat pada teori-teori HI Barat?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/zSLsMGJ1SjXMoqVR.jpg\" style=\"height:225px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: Mohamad Rosyidin</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sumber: <a href=\"https://web.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=626346437436482&amp;set=a.134038110000653&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">FB</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(hi.id): Ada beberapa poin menarik yang anda tulis di dalam buku anda terkait prospek masa depan studi Hubungan Internasional salah satunya adalah masalah melebarnya jurang antara teori dan praktik dalam Hubungan Internasional. Menurut pendapat anda, mengapa hal ini muncul? Apa solusi yang anda tawarkan terkait masalah ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(M.R): Jurang antara teori dan praktik sudah menjadi bahan perdebatan sejak lama, khususnya di AS karena ilmu HI diharapkan dapat memberikan masukan bagi perumusan kebijakan luar negeri AS. Jurang ini tetap sulit dijembatani hingga kini karena sejumlah alasan. Pertama, dunia akademik dan birokrasi amat berbeda kulturnya. Dunia akademik berfokus pada riset yang orientasinya adalah penemuan teori atau konsep baru. Aktivitas riset ini berlangsung cukup lama. Pada peneliti ibarat pemburu yang selalu penasaran dengan ke mana larinya hewan buruannya. Peneliti akan terus menggali data untuk mencari jawaban atas pertanyaannya sendiri. Sebaliknya, dunia birokrasi tidak butuh analisis njlimet dan memakan waktu seperti itu. Pembuat kebijakan membutuhkan solusi segera yang dapat diimplementasikan. Karena itu, yang mereka butuhkan adalah gagasan-gagasan konkret, bukan teori atau konsep yang abstrak. Kedua, dalam kasus khusus Indonesia, pemerintah agaknya kurang menaruh minat pada riset sebagai dasar perumusan kebijakan. <em>Research-based policy</em> belum menjadi budaya di Indonesia. Hal ini berbeda dengan di negara-negara maju dimana lembaga-lembaga riset dan perguruan tinggi menyuplai gagasan sebagai bahan masukan bagi pemerintah mereka. Di Indonesia, pemerintah agaknya lebih senang berjalan sendiri ketimbang melibatkan kalangan akademisi. Alhasil, pemerintah membuat kebijakan berdasarkan logika mereka sendiri sementara pada saat bersamaan kalangan akademisi nyaman berdiri di menara gading. Untuk menjembataninya, paling tidak ada tiga hal yang perlu diperhatikan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pertama</em>, pemerintah perlu mengubah pola pikir bahwa riset penting bagi kebijakan. Pemerintah tidak boleh alergi terhadap riset. Kalau boleh berpendapat, pemerintah Indonesia saat ini terkesan antipati terhadap intelektualisme dan memilih pendekatan praktis dan pragmatis. Pemerintah perlu mendukung dan membudayakan <em>research-based policy</em> seperti yang dilakukan di negara-negara maju.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Kedua</em>, kalangan akademisi perlu &lsquo;turun gunung&rsquo; untuk memproduksi gagasan-gagasan inovatif yang memberikan dampak terhadap kebijakan. Publikasi harus lebih banyak bersentuhan dengan aspek perumusan kebijakan. Terbitan yang dikelola lembaga riset, pusat studi, maupun universitas sebaiknya berorientasi pada produksi pengetahuan yang relevan untuk kebijakan (<em>policy relevant knowledge</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Ketiga</em>, hubungan pemerintah dan dunia kampus harus lebih erat. Perlu peningkatan kerjasama yang lebih intensif antar kedua lembaga. Pertemuan-pertemuan ilmiah seperti lokakarya, workshop, seminar, dan diskusi ilmiah harus lebih sering dilakukan. Hal ini penting untuk menjembatani perbedaan cara pandang antara kalangan birokrat dan akademisi. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>(hi.id): Terima kasih atas kesediaannya menjawab pertanyaan dari kami.

(44,23,1,'Mengapa Negara Berutang? Apa Tantangannya?','',NULL,'<p>Oleh: Herlina (Mahasiswa Hubungan Internasional Universitas Sebelas Maret)<br />\r\nEditor: Randhi Satria</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNegara bertanggung jawab untuk menyediakan fasilitas sarana dan prasarana untuk masyarakat. Hal itu diwujudkan melalui pembangunan yang merata agar dapat mencakup seluruh wilayah dan dinikmati oleh masyarakatnya. Negara tentu membutuhkan banyak sekali anggaran untuk mewujudkan hal tersebut. Oleh karena itu, negara perlu memaksimalkan pendapatannya untuk merealisasikan pembangunan tersebut. Sumber pendapatan negara yang didapat melalui pajak dan retribusi digenjot agar dapat memperbesar APBN (Anggaran Pendapatan Belanja Negara) dan APBD (Anggaran Pendapatan Belanja Daerah). Akan tetapi, bukan tidak mungkin semua modal capital yang didapat melalui pajak dan retribusi saja tidak cukup untuk melakukan pembangunan. Negara perlu memikirkan hal lain untuk mendapatkan sumber modal guna melakukan pembangunan. Untuk itu, negara merasa perlu untuk berutang kepada pihak lain seperti negara. Hal inilah yang disebut dengan utang luar negeri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSebelum membahas lebih jauh mengenai utang, maka perlu diketahui terlebih dahulu definisi dari utang, khususnya utang pemerintah. Utang adalah kewajiban yang timbul dari peristiwa masa lalu yang penyelesaiannya mengakibatkan aliran keluar sumber daya ekonomi pemerintah, dimana utang pemerintah mencakup Pinjaman Luar Negeri (PLN) dan Surat Berharga Negara (SBN). Pada artikel ini, saya mengajak pembaca untuk membahas masalah utang. Adapun utang yang dimaksud merupakan utang berdasarkan pinjaman luar negeri dan surat berharga negara. Berikut penjelasannya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Perlunya Utang</strong><br />\r\nBerdasarkan laman Kementerian Keuangan&nbsp; RI, utang diperlukan karena adanya kebutuhan belanja negara yang penting seperti penyediaan fasilitas kesehatan dan ketahahan pangan, pembiayaan pembangunan untuk penyediaan infrastruktur dan meningkatkan Indeks Pembangunan Manusia (IPM) Indonesia. Peningkatan IPM ini juga harus didasari dengan peningkatan sektor pendidikan, kesehatan, dan perlindungan sosial. Untuk memenuhi kebutuhan di berbagai sektor tersebut, sedangkan pendapatan negara/modal operasional tidak mencukupi untuk pembiayaannya maka perlu suatu solusi. Salah satunya dapat ditempuh dengan cara memangkas belanja negara tersebut, yang mana akan mengakibatkan beberapa tujuan negara tidak tercapai dan rakyat yang akan terkena dampaknya. Sedangkan cara lainnya dapat dilakukan oleh negara yakni dengan melakukan pinjaman, tentu diiringi dengan beberapa konsekuensi. Negara Indonesia sejak dahulu memilih solusi yang kedua dengan melakukan utang. Dikutip dari detik.com, Statistik Utang Luar Negeri Indonesia (SULNI) per kuartal I 2019, negara yang memberikan utang kepada Indonesia antara lain, Singapura, Jepang, Amerika Serikat (AS), China, Hong Kong dan masih banyak negara Eropa dan Asia lainnya. Meskipun utang luar negeri Indonesia terlihat cukup tinggi jumlahnya, namun dilihat dari rasio utang pemerintah masih tergolong aman, dimana sesuai dengan amanat undang-undang keuangan Indonesia, masih jauh di bawah 60% dari pendapatan domestik bruto negara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Perwujudan utang</strong><br />\r\nUtang luar negeri yang berupa modal capital ini kemudian berubah wujudnya menjadi aset. Negara mengalokasikan modal capital tersebut ke dalam pembangunan aset-aset penting yang dapat menghasilkan keuntungan. Hasil revaluasi aset tahun 2017 terhadap sekitar 40 persen aset negara memperlihatkan nilai aset negara meningkat 239 persen, dari Rp781 triliun menjadi Rp2.648 triliun, atau naik sebesar Rp1.867 triliun. Aset negara mulai dari tanah, gedung, jalan, jembatan, sekolah, rumah sakit dan lain-lain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/tS76gyowoOwT0sZv.jpg\" style=\"height:165px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://www.indonesiana.id/read/111442/udang-di-balik-batu-hubungan-ekonomi-indonesia-china\">https://www.indonesiana.id/read/111442/udang-di-balik-batu-hubungan-ekonomi-indonesia-china</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nProyek infrastruktur yang dibiayai dengan utang untuk menambah aset negara contohnya, Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Jakarta, Waduk Jatigede, dan Double Track Cirebon-Kroya. Selain dalam bentuk fisik, aset yang dapat dirasakan rakyat meliputi 19,7 juta siswa pada tahun 2017-2018 mendapatkan Kartu Indonesia Pintar, dimana hal ini bertujuan untuk pengoptimalan bonus demografi 2045 kelak. Seluruh aset negara ini diharapkan dapat berfungsi maksimal dalam menghasilkan pemasukan kepada negara melalui pajak dan retribusi. Dengan demikian, negara akan mendapatkan penghasilan tambahan yang dapat digunakan untuk membayar utang, membangun aset dll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>T</strong><strong>antangan dalam berutang</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Korupsi<br />\r\nDilansir dari laman kompas.com, Manajer Riset Transparency International Indonesia (TII), Wawan Suyatmiko menyampaikan bahwa skor Indeks Persepsi Korupsi atau Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) Indonesia tahun 2018 mengalami kenaikan satu poin menjadi 38 dengan ranking 89 dari 180 negara yang disurvei. Meskipun telah terjadi peningkatan, skor tersebut masih kategori negara yang cenderung korup. Hal ini dapat dilihat dari kasus korupsi yang kerap kali menjerat pejabat publik. Korupsi tingkat pemerintah daerah merupakan salah satu tindakan yang marak terjadi di Indonesia. Umumnya dana proyek infrastruktur yang dikorupsi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hal ini menjadikan anggaran belanja negara tidak mencapai target yang tepat dan justru merugikan kas negara. Padahal anggaran itu berasal dari utang sebelumnya, yang diharapkan dengan adanya pembangunan dapat meningkatkan pendapatan pemerintah. Namun yang terjadi justru sebaliknya, kas negara berkurang dan negara tetap harus menutupi kerugian agar operasional proyek tetap berjalan, serta kas negara yang defisit perlu tambahan dana dari luar untuk menjaga kelancaran operasional negara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Miss management / Kesalahan Manajemen<br />\r\nKesalahan manajemen ini dapat berasal dari berbagai pihak, baik dari sisi manajemen sumber daya manusianya maupun manajemen keuangannya. Dari segi sumber daya manusia,&nbsp; rendahnya kualitas SDM dalam berkoordinasi antara pemerintah dengan masyarakat dapat berakibat ketidaksesuaian aset yang nantinya akan dibangun oleh pemerintah dari dana utang. Akibatnya pembangunan proyek untuk aset justru berhenti di tengah jalan bahkan mangkrak dan tidak berguna bagi kepentingan publik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tentunya hal ini sangat merugikan bukan? Kesalahan yang kedua, kesalahan manajemen keuangan dimana berasal dari kesalahan dalam mengalokasikan sumber pendapatan dari utang untuk kebutuhan yang konsumtif, bukan mengarah pada belanja aset negara atau investasi baik jangka pendek maupun panjang yang menguntungkan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bunga dan denda yang besar<br />\r\nSudah menjadi hal wajar, apabila melakukan pinjaman disertai dengan bunga, namun umumnya bunga atas utang negara ini cukup besar dan mayoritas merupakan utang jangka panjang. Dikutip dari cnnindonesia.com, Pemerintah saat ini mengalokasikan anggaran Rp396,54 triliun untuk membayar bunga dan cicilan pokok utang dalam APBN 2019. Jumlah yang cukup fantastis bukan? Konsekuensi dari bunga yang cukup besar dan tidak diimbangi dengan keuntungan yang sepadan atau lebih, akan merugikan kas negara, dimana kas yang seharusnya bertambah dengan modal utang, justru mengalami kerugian karena utang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selain bunga, ketika telah jatuh tempo pembayaran utang luar negeri, negara berkewajiban untuk membayar. Acapkali jika negara belum mampu membayar, mereka akan saling bernegosiasi untuk tenggang waktu yang diberikan. Pemberian kelonggaran ini belum tentu dibayar gratis, bisa jadi terdapat denda yang harus dibayarkan. Sehingga negara yang belum bisa membayar dibebankan lagi denda yang memperburuk kondisi keuangan negara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Debt trap</em>/jebakan utang<br />\r\nDalam hal pemberian pinjaman dari negara maju kepada negara berkembang, tentunya memiliki kepentingan dan agenda tersembunyi yang biasanya berkaitan dengan unsur ekonomi dan politik negara pengutang/debitur. Agenda tersembunyi itu dapat terbukti dengan adanya jebakan utang. Jika negara debitur mengalami krisis ekonomi, utang menumpuk, dan tidak disertai kemampuan untuk membayar, maka jebakan utanglah yang terjadi. Di lain kondisi, bila negara debitur dapat membayar ke negara kreditur, namun dengan cara melakukan utang pada pihak lain, hanya ini menimbulkan lingkaran utang yang semakin berbelit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Istilah jebakan utang semakin booming seiring dengan gencarnya China memberikan pinjaman ke negara-negara Afrika dan yang lainnya, dimana disinyalir merupakan suatu proyek besar China, proyek One Belt One Road (OBOR) atau kini disebut Belt Road Initiative (BRI). Proyek ini dinilai sebagai upaya China dalam mengukuhkan dominasinya dalam perdagangan global. Hal ini terbukti dari menjamurnya produk China ke seluruh dunia.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/L2y_k9CD3ZARgepC.jpg\" style=\"height:169px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image : <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/03/08/in-south-asia-chinese-infrastructure-brings-debt-and-antagonism\">https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/03/08/in-south-asia-chinese-infrastructure-brings-debt-and-antagonism</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Persoalan utang piutang tentunya berbeda dengan persoalan kerjasama, bila kerjasama lebih pada keduanya dalam posisi sama untuk tujuan yang sama, sedangkan utang piutang lebih mengarah pada dorongan kebutuhan modal salah satu pihak dan pihak lain memfasilitasi dengan bunga atas pinjaman. Kasus proyek BRI yang terkenal yakni penjualan 70 persen saham senilai 1,1 triliun USD atas Pelabuhan Hambantota, Sri Lanka pada BUMN China. Hal ini dilakukan mengingat Sri Lanka tidak mampu membayar utangnya. Mayoritas negara yang terkena proyek BRI, akan mendapat stimulus baik dana maupun pekerja dari China untuk membangun infrastruktur, contohnya Indonesia. Proyek kereta cepat Jakarta-Bandung melibatkan dua kontraktor dari China yakni China Railway Group Limited dan Sinohydro Corporation Limited. Keputusan ini berdasar pengalaman kontraktor China tersebut. Untuk saat ini sistem kerjasama antara Indonesia dan China masih dalam konteks <em>Business to Business</em> (B to B) bukan<em> Government to Government</em> (G to G). Meski demikian, proyek ini&nbsp; perlu pengawasan pula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Untuk lebih jelas mengenai <em>debt trap</em>, simak video berikut ini:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/QgXLfDApqR0\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\r\nVideo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgXLfDApqR0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgXLfDApqR0</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Akhir Kata</strong><br />\r\nDari pembahasan di atas, dapat disimpulkan bahwa negara berutang untuk memenuhi kebutuhan modal negara tersebut, tentunya diiringi dengan pertimbangan PDB negara dengan rasio utang yang telah ditentukan undang-undang. Namun perlu diwaspadai pula besaran bunga dan jangka waktu yang diberikan, apakah negara mampu membayar utangnya kelak atau tidak. Hal tersebut perlu dipertimbangkan agar tidak terjerat jebakan utang. Hal lain yang dapat dilakukan dalam menilik utang negara yakni efektivitas utang, dimana utang tersebut dapat&nbsp; dimaksimalkan untuk pembangunan yang akan memberikan keuntungan bagi negara. Sehingga dari keuntungan yang dihasilkan dapat digunakan untuk membayar utang dan bunganya. Perlu diketahui pula bahwa kasus korupsi dan kesalahan manajemen dapat berdampak buruk terhadap utang negara yakni pembebanan kembali utang tersebut kepada masyarakat melalui pajak yang diberlakukan oleh negara.

Pasca perang besar yang memakan jutaan jiwa dan kerugian finansial bagi banyak negara, PBB hadir menjadi &lsquo;jembatan&rsquo; yang menghubungi negara-negara satu sama lain untuk kembali bangkit dari keterpurukan pasca perang dan menata dunia agar menjadi lebih baik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ada <a href=\"https://www.un.org/un70/en/content/history/index.html\">empat tujuan</a> didirikannya PBB, yang <em>pertama</em> adalah menjaga perdamaian dunia. <em>Kedua</em>, menciptakan hubungan yang baik antara negara. <em>Ketiga</em>, membantu negara-negara dalam bekerjasama untuk meningkatkan kualitas hidup dari masyarakat miskin, mengatasi masalah kelaparan, penyakit dan buta huruf, serta mendorong rasa hormat terhadap hak dan kebebasan. Dan yang <em>keempat</em>, menjadi penengah dalam harmonisasi hubungan antar negara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selama masa perjalanannya, ada banyak tantangan dan kritik terhadap PBB. Salah satunya adalah kritik terhadap anggota tetap dewan keamanan PBB.Hal ini menjadi bagian yang dibahas dari perdebatan tentang reformasi PBB khususnya yang berkaitan dengan Dewan Keamanan (DK). Artikel ini ditulis untuk mengulas wacana reformasi DK PBB sekaligus dalam rangka (akan) menyambut ulang tahunnya yang ke-75.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DK PBB menjadi salah satu posisi istimewa yang sarat akan <em>prestige</em> di PBB. Sejak berdirinya PBB, anggota tetap DK PBB diisi oleh lima negara pemenang perang yaitu Amerika Serikat, Inggris, Prancis, Russia (Uni Soviet), dan China. Lima negara ini dianggap telah berkontribusi besar terhadap berakhirnya Perang Dunia II dengan menaklukkan Axis power (blok poros) yang terdiri dari Italia, Jerman dan Jepang. Sebagaimana pepatah realis yang mengatakan &ldquo;<em>the winner get what they want and the weak suffer what they must</em>&rdquo;, negara pemenang perang ini memposisikan diri mereka sebagai &lsquo;para penjaga keamanan&rsquo; dan merupakan negara-negara yang mendukung berdirinya PBB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pada awalnya, DK PBB terdiri dari 11 negara anggota sampai kemudian <a href=\"https://research.un.org/en/unmembers\">diamandemen pada tahun 1963</a> menjadi 15 negara. Anggota tetap DK PBB terdiri dari 5 negara yang telah disebutkan. Sedangkan 10 sisanya merupakan anggota tidak tetap, yang posisinya dirotasi setiap 2 tahun sekali. Selain itu ada pula 50 <em>non-council member states</em>. Indonesia termasuk dalam salah satu negara yang pernah tiga kali duduk sebagai anggota tidak tetap DK PBB. Terakhir Indonesia terpilih sebagai anggota tidak tetap DK PBB pada tahun 2018 dengan masa jabatan sampai <a href=\"https://kemlu.go.id/portal/en/read/147/halaman_list_lainnya/indonesian-membership-on-the-un-security-council\">30 Desember 2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seiring dengan berjalannya waktu, wacana tentang reformasi PBB turut menyeret masalah posisi keanggotaan DK PBB. Salah satu akar permasalahan yang mendorong reformasi ini adalah anggapah bahwa DK PBB tidak merepresentasikan kepentingan ataupun pandangan banyak negara, hanya lima negara anggota tetap saja. Anggapan miring ini dapat dilihat juga dari anggota tetap DK PBB yang sering menggunakan kekuasaannya dan terlibat dalam konflik internasional dengan mengatasnamakan menjaga stabilitas keamanan internasional. Alih-alih menjaga keamanan dunia, para negara anggota tetap DK PBB malah sering kali memperburuk kondisi konflik yang ada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/a4LBz-Yjm1CVyA5l.jpg\" style=\"height:157px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2019/09/24/representation-problems-in-the-current-un-security-council\">https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2019/09/24/representation-problems-in-the-current-un-security-council</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DK PBB juga dianggap tidak mampu memberikan kontribusi sesuai dengan harapan negara-negara dalam penyelesaian masalah keamanan di level internasional maupun regional yang disebabkan oleh tarik ulur kepentingan negara anggota tetapnya. Selain itu, eksklusifitas yang dimiliki oleh para anggota tetap dianggap tidak sejalan dengan semangat kebersamaan dan kesetaraan antar negara-negara anggota. Hal-hal seperti ini tentu mengundang tanda tanya tersendiri bagi kredibilitas PBB yang dianggap tidak mampu menjadi representasi dari kepentingan banyak negara. Untuk itu, tuntutan terhadap reformasi DK PBB muncul dan mengundang perdebatan antar delegasi negara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/HPAONq36HKg\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPAONq36HKg\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPAONq36HKg</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pada tahun 2006, pembahasan mengenai reformasi itu dibahas di PBB. Representasi dari <a href=\"https://www.un.org/press/en/2006/ga10485.doc.htm\">Tanzania</a> misalnya, menyuarakan pentingnya melakukan reformasi DK PBB, kegagalan dalam melakukan reformasi dan ekspansi dari anggota tetap DK PBB dianggap akan mempengaruhi legitimasi dari Dewan. Lebih lanjut dalam pernyataannya, kondisi ketidakadilan ini terlihat jelas di DK PBB dan negara berkembang menjadi korban utama dari ketidakadilan tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tanggapan lain datang dari representasi <a href=\"https://www.un.org/press/en/2006/ga10485.doc.htm\">Nauru</a> yang menyebutkan bahwa fungsi DK PBB dianggap tidak relevan dengan keadaan geopolitik saat ini, karena terlalu mewakili kondisi keamanan tahun 1945 sebagaimana ketika awal pembentukannya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Menanggapi keinginan reformasi DK PBB, pada tahun 2010 Presiden Majelis <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/ga/president/65/\">Joseph Deis</a> mengatakan bahwa keputusan untuk mereformasi terletak di keinginan para negara. Merujuk pada fakta bahwa <a href=\"https://www.un.org/press/en/2010/ga11022.doc.htm\">penambahan</a> keanggotaan DK PBB pernah dilakukan pada 1963 dari 11 anggota menjadi 15 anggota. Meski mayoritas negara-negara menyetujui perlunya reformasi pada DK PBB, <a href=\"https://www.un.org/press/en/2010/ga11022.doc.htm\">perdebatan</a> khususnya terletak pada seberapa besar penambahan DK PBB dan negara mana saja yang akan mengisi penambahan jumlah keanggotaan tersebut?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pembahasan mengenai reformasi DK PBB pun masih terus berlanjut pada tahun 2015. Wacana penambahan anggota tetap DK PBB memunculkan opsi seperti penambahan berdasarkan region. Representasi dari <a href=\"https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/ga11715.doc.htm\">Sierra Leone</a>, berbicara mewakili negara-negara Afrika, meminta jatah penambahan 2 kursi sebagai anggota tetap DK PBB dan 2 kursi sebagai anggota tidak tetap untuk negara dari Afrika. Tidak tanggung-tanggung, delegasi ini juga meminta jatah hak veto bagi dua negara afrika yang duduk sebagai anggota tetap DK PBB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perdebatan mengenai reformasi DK PBB masih terus berlanjut. Pada tahun 2018, menanggapi tuntutan dari para negara anggota yang menginginkan penambahan jumlah kursi anggota tetap DK PBB dan penghapusan hak veto, delegasi Amerika Serikat menyatakan negaranya mendukung untuk &lsquo;ekspansi kecil&rsquo; terkait anggota tetap dan anggota tidak tetap. Tapi, ia menolak segala bentuk perubahan atas penggunaan hak veto. Hal senada juga diutarakan oleh delegasi Russia yang membela <a href=\"https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/ga12091.doc.htm\">hak veto</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/ahOCVzvHwqX0rqWw.jpeg\" style=\"height:353px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cartoonmovement.shop/cartoon/un-veto-power-64-years-injustice\">https://cartoonmovement.shop/cartoon/un-veto-power-64-years-injustice</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dengan banyaknya permasalahan keamanan yang dihadapi sekarang ini, dan tentunya kondisi yang sudah jauh berbeda sejak 1945, tuntutan reformasi DK PBB ini tentu menjadi pembahasan penting di PBB. Tuntutan reformasi terhadap DK PBB sejauh ini agaknya lebih memungkinkan untuk diarahkan pada perluasan (penambahan) anggota tetap dan anggota tidak tetap DK PBB. Penambahan keanggotaan ini bisa diisi oleh negara berdasarkan region tertentu untuk mewakili regionnya di DK PBB. Akan tetapi apakah negara-negara tersebut memiliki hak veto sebagaimana 5 negara utama? Saya rasa untuk yang satu ini tidak akan terwujud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pembahasan mengenai reformasi DK PBB ini masih akan berlanjut beberapa tahun ke depan, atau bisa juga lebih lama lagi. Menarik untuk dilihat lebih lanjut apakah pasca reformasi tersebut PBB mampu menjadi organisasi yang lebih baik atau justru akan memperumit masalah yang sudah ada dengan semakin banyaknya tarik ulur kepentingan antar negara di anggota tetap dan anggota tidak tetap DK PBB. Karena perubahan itu perlu, maka perubahan pula yang diharapkan dari organisasi internasional ini sejak kurang lebih 75 tahun organisasi ini berdiri. Tentunya, DK PBB juga termasuk dalam hal yang membutuhkan perubahan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Pembahasan mengenai wacana reformasi DK PBB','','032020',2,1,1482,NULL,1585630800,1585671249,1607087516,1,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,1499),
(46,25,1,'Dilema Indonesia: Green Water Navy dan Poros Maritim Dunia','',NULL,'<p>Ditulis oleh Arif Sulistio Budi (Mahasiswa Hubungan Internasional Universitas Sebelas Maret)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Editor: Virtuous Setyaka</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nNegara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia (NKRI) - selanjutnya disebut Indonesia - dikategorikan sebagai negara kepulauan terbesar di dunia. Sebagai negara kepulauan, kedaulatan wilayah Indonesia didominasi oleh perairan. Mengingat posisi geografis Indonesia yang strategis diantara dua benua dan dua samudera, maka wilayah perairannya termasuk padat dari segi jalur pelayaran internasional. Pelayaran merupakan moda perhubungan paling populer di dunia karena efektivitas perpindahan barang antar wilayah dalam jumlah besar dapat terpenuhi. Indonesia merupakan negara penting bagi jalur pelayaran internasional karena memiliki jalur laut yang berfungsi sebagai salah satu penghubung berbagai kawasan di dunia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nJalur-jalur laut yang dimiliki Indonesia juga sebagai titik rawan terhadap berbagai ancaman keamanan yang datang, baik dari dalam maupun dari luar. Ancaman dari dalam misalnya perompakan dan teorisme. Sedangkan ancaman dari luar dapat berupa pelanggaran lintas batas oleh kapal-kapal dan pesawat asing. Salah satu buktinya yaitu manuver kapal-kapal penjaga pantai Tiongkok di kawasan Natuna. Terlepas dari masalah kedaulatan maritim yang baru-baru ini berkaitan dengan tindakan Tiongkok, hal ini membuktikan Indonesia memiliki tantangan fundamental yang sejak lama sebetulnya sudah disadari. Tantangan tersebut ialah pentingnya upaya negara untuk mampu menjaga luas wilayah lautan yang dimiliki apalagi mengingat pemerintahan Joko Widodo periode pertama selalu &lsquo;bersemangat&rsquo; menggaungkan visi Poros Maritim Dunia (PMD).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/HWI2LRaqgzwP93HB.jpg\" style=\"height:135px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.go.id/narasi/indonesia-dalam-angka/ekonomi/indonesia-poros-maritim-dunia\">https://www.indonesia.go.id/narasi/indonesia-dalam-angka/ekonomi/indonesia-poros-maritim-dunia</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nVisi PMD sejatinya berfokus ke pembangunan sektor ekonomi nasional. Visi ini menjadi pengemas berbagai kebijakan nasional yang berorientasi pada pertumbuhan ekonomi berbasis kekayaan maritim. Untuk mendukung kelancaran pertumbuhan kekuatan ekonomi nasional yang berbasis kelautan ini, negara perlu menyediakan fasilitas keamanan yang memadai. Bila visi ini tercapai maka Indonesia dapat menjadi pusat perhatian dunia karena kestabilan domestik yang baik sehingga mampu memancing iklim investasi. Hal inilah yang sebetulnya menjadi garis besar PMD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nMasalahnya, PMD merupakan doktrin yang sangat membutuhkan peran sektor keamanan yang berpandangan pertahanan ke luar (<em>outward looking defense</em>). Sektor keamanan yang dimiliki oleh Indonesia aktor utamanya adalah unsur Tentara Nasional Indonesia (TNI) terutama matra laut. Sektor keamanan laut yang diserahkan kepada TNI Angkatan Laut (AL) sudah sepatutnya menjadi tulang punggung keamanan dan pertahanan nasional mengingat Indonesia sebagai negara kepulauan. Akan tetapi saat ini, kapasitas TNI AL terbatas oleh sebab minimnya alat utama sistem persenjataan (alutsista) yang dimiliki. Untuk menjaga luasnya perairan negara, TNI AL (<a href=\"https://tirto.id/kekuatan-militer-indonesia-2019-dari-senjata-hingga-pasukan-khusus-egpl\">Dayana, 2019</a>) hanya memiliki modal 8 kapal utama sekelas fregat, 24 kapal jenis korvet, 139 kapal patroli yang variannya terdiri dari kelas 40 dan 60 meter, 5 kapal selam tipe 209 yang tidak sepenuhnya beroperasi karena sebagian perlu di &lsquo;bengkel&rsquo; mengingat 2 diantaranya memiliki masa pakai yang sudah sangat lama, serta 11 pangkalan laut yang tersebar di beberapa wilayah. Hal ini masih sangat memprihatinkan meskipun saat ini keamanan laut juga sudah di tambahkan unsur Badan Keamanan Laut (Bakamla) dengan kapal-kapal patrolinya yang fokus pada pertahanan ke dalam (<em>inward looking defense</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDitambah lagi seluruh fregat dan korvet yang merupakan bagian alat pemukul utama di matra laut tersebut tidak dapat beroperasi penuh. Hal tersebut dikarenakan terbatasnya sumber daya energi (bahan bakar) sebagaimana pernah ditekankan oleh Jenderal (Purn) Gatot Nurmantyo ketika masih menjabat sebagai Panglima TNI (<a href=\"https://tirto.id/kekuatan-tni-gagap-menghadapi-ancaman-perang-modern-cxP4\">Hanifan, 2017</a>). Alat canggih sekelas kapal perang pun membutuhkan pasokan energi yang tidak sedikit untuk sekali berlayar. Itulah mengapa potensi pelanggaran batas wilayah oleh kapal-kapal berbendera asing tidak dapat diantisipasi oleh para personil keamanan di laut, disebabkan oleh terbatasnya bahan bakar bagi kapal perang ataupun kapal patroli untuk dapat berlayar disetiap waktu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nTidak hanya itu saja, kondisi alutsista di matra laut ini menunjukkan kapasitas Angkatan Laut Indonesia yang masih di level <em>Green Water Navy</em>, sebuah label yang umumnya diberikan kepada angkatan laut negara-negara berkembang karena ketersediaan alutsista matra laut yang umumnya mengandalkan fregat sebagai flagship (<a href=\"http://lipi.go.id/berita/peneliti-lipi:-indonesia-harus-miliki-blue-water-navy/4626\">Bhakti, 2010</a>). Label ini digunakan sebagai doktrin untuk menunjukkan kemampuan operasional angkatan laut dalam level regional. Ini merupakan posisi tengah bagi kapasitas angkatan laut negara-negara di dunia yang terdiri atas <em>Brown Water Navy</em> yang kapasitasnya terbatas pada pertahanan pesisir serta <em>Blue Water Navy</em> dengan kapasitas operasinya yang global. Label ini juga menjadi cerminan bagi kategorisasi anggaran pertahanan tiap negara. Sebagai negara berkembang, tidak dapat dipungkiri apabila anggaran pertahanan Indonesia tidak terlalu besar meskipun prioritasnya dalam kabinet pemerintahan (periode pertama Joko Widodo), jatah anggaran Kementerian Pertahanan menduduki peringkat tiga besar dibandingkan kementerian lainnya. Faktanya, anggaran besar pada lini pertahanan nasional juga tidak menentukan betapa kuatnya daya tahan negara dari ancaman yang akan datang di masa depan. Bisa jadi, menaikkan anggaran pertahanan memang merupakan kewajiban negara mengingat sudah terlampau banyak alutsista yang perlu diganti atau diperpanjang masa operasionalnya. Kemungkinan lainnya, memang tubuh organisasi TNI yang besar dengan tiga matra (darat, laut dan udara) sehingga anggaran pun harus besar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDi sisi lain, Andi Wijayanto pernah berkomentar di salah satu media massa mengenai doktrin TNI AL yang telah mengalami penyesuaian bila dibandingkan dengan doktrin TNI AD (<a href=\"https://m.solopos.com/tank-baru-tni-ad-punya-alutsista-baru-doktrin-pertahanan-perlu-disesuaikan-345469\">Sasangka, 2013</a>). Akan tetapi tidak bisa dipungkiri bahwa kondisi di lapangan saat ini alutsista pertahanan laut Indonesia masih terbatas dan sebaliknya malah didominasi oleh pengembangan alutsista di matra darat. Bagaimana bisa negara yang didominasi oleh lautan, bertumpu pada lautan, dan memiliki potensi besar dari kekayaan maritimnya, meninggalkan kesiapsiagaannya pada wilayah lautan yang merupakan miliknya dan harus dijaganya sendiri?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/-5dItZ3kIuMIIMsW.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foto: Arif Sulistio Budi</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nBila dipikirkan kembali, apa hubungan antara doktrin PMD dengan kapasitas TNI AL yang masih berada di level <em>Green Water Navy</em>? Sudah jelas kedua hal ini saling bertentangan. Bagaimana tidak, bahkan doktrin PMD saja merupakan sebuah <em>grand strategy</em> yang sifatnya mengglobal dan dampaknya diharapkan mencapai level internasional namun jika dilihat dari sektor penjamin keamanannya yaitu TNI AL masih terkendala pada kemampuan operasi yang terbatas pada regional saja. Belum lagi, bagaimana dengan ketahanan operasi bagi alutsista matra laut yang untuk saat ini masih tidak bisa aktif sepenuhnya karena pasokan energi yang terbatas bagi kapal-kapal perangnya. Pesimisme dalam artikel ini merupakan opini yang menjadi penyebab munculnya pertanyaan-pertanyaan berikutnya. Seperti misalnya, apakah Visi PMD ini hanya sebuah angan-angan yang terlampau jauh membawa gegap gempita masa lalu? Visi ini sudah meredup dengan segala problematika yang ada. Istilahnya, mengandalkan momentum saja tidak cukup untuk mengungguli lawan di medan tempur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sumber:</strong><br />\r\nAnggit S. Dayana (2019).

(47,22,1,'Web Seminar Hubungan Internasional (Update 1 Desember 2020)','',NULL,'<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Momen pandemic memaksa banyak pihak tetap produktif dari rumah meskipun berada di tengah kondisi yang mengharuskan setiap individu menaati <em>physica</em>l dan <em>social distancing</em>. Masyarakat pun melakukan adaptasi untuk menghadapi hal ini. Dalam dunia pendidikan, proses adaptasi tersebut mempengaruhi proses pembelajaran yang dilakukan antara dosen dan mahasiswa. Wajar rasanya jika tren pembelajaran berbasis online ini meningkat dalam beberapa waktu belakangan. Mulai dari kuliah online, ujian online, bahkan sampai seminar online yang biasa juga disebut dengan webinar (web seminar). Berbeda dengan kuliah maupun ujian online, webinar merupakan sesuatu yang sifatnya lebih terbuka dan dapat diakses oleh banyak pihak (tergantung pada kapasitas yang disediakan oleh <em>host</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/4o-U2KUVrqFeJYnV.jpeg\" style=\"height:300px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@shauryasinha88/top-10-benefits-of-using-webinar-to-host-online-classes-c53409944acf\">https://medium.com/@shauryasinha88/top-10-benefits-of-using-webinar-to-host-online-classes-c53409944acf</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Untuk itu, sebagai bagian dari masyarakat yang banyak bertumpu pada penggunaan web sebagai media pembelajaran, kami dari tim hubunganinternaisonal.id pun berniat untuk ikut mengambil bagian dengan mendukung pembelajaran model online ini dengan cara menghimpun informasi tentang penyelenggaraan webinar dengan tema yang memiliki kaitan tentang Hubungan Internasional. Berikut adalah sekumpulan informasi tentang webinar dengan kajian yang memiliki keterkaitan dengan hubungan internasional yang berhasil kami himpun.

(48,23,1,'Military-Entertainment Complex: Simbiosis Industri Perfilman Holywood dan Militer Sebagai Bentuk Implementasi Soft Power & Propaganda Amerika Serikat','',NULL,'<p style=\"text-align:center\">Penulis: Arif Darmawan</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">(Dosen Hubungan Internasional FISIP UNSOED Purwokerto, Pengkaji Studi Budaya Populer dalam Hubungan Internasional)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Pengantar</strong><br />\r\nIndustri budaya populer Amerika Serikat bisa dikatakan menjadi <em>mainstream</em> atau dominan dalam dunia hiburan internasional. Apabila kita bicara mengenai industri perfilman, industri musik, industri <em>game</em>, bisa dikatakan hampir semua sumbernya dari Negara adidaya tersebut. Dengan semakin majunya teknologi yang menyertai derasnya arus globalisasi, keberadaan industri hiburan dari Amerika Serikat semakin dominan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari masyarakat di seluruh dunia. Dari perspektif Hubungan Internasional, dominasi industri hiburan Amerika Serikat merupakan sebuah perwujudan penerapan <em>soft power</em> dari Negara tersebut. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nJika mengacu pada pengertian power dalam studi Hubungan Internasional adalah kemampuan manusia untuk mengendalikan atau mempengaruhi manusia lain, atau dalam konteks Negara adalah bagaimana sebuah Negara mempengaruhi dan mengendalikan Negara lain (Mansbach, 2008). Istilah <em>soft power</em> sendiri dipopulerkan oleh Joseph Nye yang maknanya adalah satu kemampuan atau kekuatan untuk mempengaruhi pihak lain melalui upaya membangun pola hubungan ikatan emosional atau ikatan yang erat dengan menggunakan karisma, komunikasi yang persuasif, daya tarik ideologi yang visioner, serta melalui pengaruh budaya (Nye, 2008).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nIndustri hiburan Amerika Serikat jelas merupakan perwujudan <em>soft power</em> Negara adidaya tersebut. Melalui industri hiburan yang dimiliki Amerika Serikat secara eksplisit dan implisit menanamkan nilai-nilai Barat, propaganda serta penyebaran informasi dalam semua produknya dengan tujuan tentu saja agar pihak lain, dalam hal ini adalah konsumen industri budaya Amerika Serikat di seluruh dunia tertarik dan mengagumi dengan Amerika Serikat sehingga ada keterikatan emosional dengan Negara tersebut, yang tentu saja hal ini akan berkorelasi positif bagi kebijakan politik dan ekonomi Amerika Serikat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSalah satu fenomena terkait dengan bagaimana pemerintah Amerika Serikat menggunakan <em>soft power</em> nya dalam industri budaya populernya adalah fenomena <em>Military-Entetainment Complex</em>. Menurut Wark (2005)<em> Military-entertainment complex</em> sendiri adalah merupakan sebuah fenomena dimana industri hiburan dimanfaatkan oleh militer untuk menyampaikan pesan-pesan dari kebijakan luar negeri Amerika Serikat. Pada intinya, hubungan ini dapat digambarkan sebagai simbiosis di mana industri hiburan, seringkali didanai sebagian besar oleh produsen senjata atau oleh <em>Department of Defence</em>, yang menghasilkan narasi dalam upaya untuk melakukan persuasi atau propaganda, dan juga dalam perang informasi (<em>information warfare</em>) (Stockwell &amp; Muir, 2003).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Melalui kerjasama antara industri budaya popular dan industri militer serta Departemen Pertahanan, dimunculkan narasi mengenai &lsquo;rasionalisasi&rsquo; politik hegemoni Amerika Serikat, termasuk didalamnya adalah marketing industri militer dan peran militer Amerika Serikat secara umum (Wark, 2005). Simbiosis antara militer dengan industri budaya populer ini bisa dilacak terutama pada industri perfilman Holywood dan juga industri komik dan<em> game</em> atau permainan elektronik baik di <em>platform console</em> maupun <em>personal computer</em>. Dalam tulisan ini akan mengulas bagaimana sinergi dan simbiosis antara industri budaya popular dan militer di Amerika Serikat yang terwujud dalam fenomena <em>military-entertainment complex</em>, terutama dalam dunia industri perfilman Holywood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Military-Entertainment Complex Dalam Industri Perfilman Holywood</strong><br />\r\nJika membaca sejarah, keterkaitan antara industri sinema Amerika Serikat dengan militer dan kebijakan luar negeri Negara tersebut, bisa dikatakan dimulai dengan kisah seorang warga Negara Inggris yang bernama J. Stuart Blackton, yang merupakan salah satu pendiri perusahaan <em>Vitagraph Corporation of America</em> pada tahun 1897. Blackton bisa dikatakan orang pertama yang memproduksi sebuah film dengan tujuan propaganda perang, yang berjudul &lsquo;<em>Tearing Down The Spanish Flag</em>&rsquo; (Scott, 2013). Film ini muncul di tengah kontroversi konflik antara Amerika Serikat dengan Spanyol di Kuba waktu itu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSeperti halnya komik, relasi antara industri hiburan dengan militer sangat terlihat jelas pada masa Perang Dunia 2, ketika perusahaan seperti <em>Paramount</em> dan <em>Disney</em> terlibat dalam pembuatan film propaganda dalam rangka untuk mengalahkan Nazi. Hanya saja, tidak seperti komik, relasi ini sampai saat ini masih sangat kuat, sehingga banyak film baik itu di bioskop maupun di stasiun TV ada keterlibatan militer Amerika Serikat didalamnya. Pasca Perang Dunia 2, sejak tahun 1948 Militer Amerika Serikat melalui Pentagon telah memiliki kantor penghubung di Holywood. Tetapi sinergi antara Departemen Pertahanan dengan Holywood tercatat sudah ada sejak tahun 1911 (Alford, 2017). Dari tahun 1911 sampai dengan 2017 saja ada lebih dari 800 film yang menerima support atau dukungan dari Pentagon, dan ada lebih dari 1100 judul, dan 900 diantaranya mulai dari tahun 2005 (Howard, 2018). Selain itu CIA sendiri telah membantu pembuatan lebih dari 60 film Holywood sejak tahun 1947. Menurut Howard (2018) bahkan CIA pada tahun 1950an terlibat langsung untuk mempengaruhi banyak produser film agar di film mereka sering menyebutkan nama CIA, kemudian juga pernah menghalangi pembuatan film berbiaya besar&nbsp; dibintangi oleh Marlon Brando yang mengisahkan mengenai skandal <em>Iran Contra</em>, salah satu skandal paling memalukan dalam sejarah politik luar negeri Amerika Serikat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nMiliter Amerika Serikat atau Departemen Pertahanan juga menggunakan media film sebagai sarana untuk propaganda dan rekrutmen tentara. Sebagai contoh film yang disponsori secara resmi oleh Pentagon adalah film <em>Top Gun</em> (1986), dan melalui kesuksesan film ini kemudian berefek pada peningkatan secara drastis jumlah pendaftar ke angkatan bersenjata (Evje, 1986). Setelah itu ada banyak film yang secara resmi disponsori oleh militer Amerika Serikat, mulai dari film perang Vietnam seperti <em>Rambo</em>, perang melawan melawan alien seperti <em>Independece Day</em> dan <em>Battlefield</em>, film <em>blockbuster</em> seperti <em>Transformers</em>, film yang menceritakan penangkapan Osama bin Laden <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em>,<em> Lone Survivor</em>, <em>Act of Valor</em> yang dibintangi oleh marinir sendiri, dan juga film superhero Marvel seperti <em>Iron Man</em> (McKay, 2016). Kemudian film-film film tentang aksi militer di Amerika Serikat di Timur Tengah seperti 12 <em>Strong</em>:<em> The Declassified True Story Of The Horse Soldier</em>, 13 <em>Hours Benghazi</em>, dan banyak lagi, termasuk didalamnya adalah serial TV popular seperti <em>Homeland</em> dan <em>Jack Ryan</em>. Keterlibatan militer Amerika Serikat di banyak film tersebut adalah mulai dari supervisi naskah, konsultan adegan aksi dan persenjataan, sampai dengan kerjasama dalam menyewakan peralatan perang yang dimiliki. Beberapa film seperti <em>Top Gun</em> dan <em>Act of Valor</em> bahkan menjadi alat rekrutmen yang efektif bagi militer Amerika Serikat.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/0XwfcVqSZzWWAS2v.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:500px\" /><br />\r\nGambar: Tom Cruise dalam film Top Gun (1986).

Pemerintah Amerika Serikat melalui Pentagon bisa memasukkan agenda politik dan kebijakan laur negeri melalui film-film tersebut baik secara langsung maupun tidak langsung, baik dengan cara memainkan narasi film sehingga terjadi upaya &lsquo;rasionalisasi&rsquo; aktivitas militer Amerika Serikat di seluruh dunia, di sisi lain industri perfilman Holywood juga diuntungkan karena melalui kerjasama ini ada akses untuk pemakaian peralatan militer sampai dengan personel, serta terutama adalah untuk memenuhi keinginan pasar (Kaempf, 2018).<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/G38J-MWKsGPi-OjO.png\" style=\"height:300px; width:500px\" /><br />\r\nGrafik: Anggaran Militer Amerika Serikat 1947-2017. Sumber: Kaempf (2018)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nKeuntungan lain dari relasi military-entertainment complex ini adalah dari sisi marketing industri militer Amerika Serikat. Dengan semakin meningkatnya anggaran militer Amerika Serikat, yang ber efek pada peningkatan industri militer, tentu saja membutuhkan strategi yang efektif untuk memasarkan peralatan militer mereka. Disinilah kemudian selain melalui kebijakan Amerika Serikat secara umum, penggunaan industri hiburan ternyata juga sangat efektif dalam memperkenalkan dan memperlihatkan kapabilitas persenjataan Amerika Serikat ke seluruh dunia. Kemudian para akademisi tidak lagi hanya membicarakan <em>military-industrial complex</em>, tetapi sudah meluas menjadi &lsquo;<em>The Military-Industrial-Media-Entertainment-Network</em>&rsquo;, atau MIME-Net (Der Derian, 2009). <em>MIME-Net</em> memfokuskan pada bagaimana kolaborasi baik informal maupun formal antara militer, politisi, industri militer di satu pihak, dengan industri hiburan serta akademisi di pihak lain, serta bagaimana keterlibatan media yang juga ikut serta dimobilisasi melalui industri hiburan dalam rangka upaya propaganda dan perang informasi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Penutup</strong><br />\r\nDengan melihat fenomena <em>military-entertainment complex</em> (Der Derian menyebutnya dengan istilah <em>Military-Industrial-Media-Entertainment-Network</em>), kita melihat adanya Amerika Serikat selama ini untuk terus melakukan glorifikasi terhadap aksi militerisme yang dilakukan di seluruh dunia, dan juga aksi kekerasan yang mengirinya.<em> Military-entertainment-complex</em> tidak hanya terkait dengan memproduksi propaganda, tetapi seringkali sekedar memenuhi selera pasar akan adanya film-film yang apolitis dan kategori <em>popcorn</em> atau ringan, tetapi didalamnya tetap disampaikan pesan-pesan implisit mengenai &lsquo;rasionalisasi&rsquo; peran militer Amerika Serikat di dunia, dan ini merupakan refleksi dari kebijakan luar negeri Negara tersebut. Terlepas dari kontroversi yang mengiringinya, fenomena <em>military-enertainemt-complex</em> sendiri merupakan sebuah gambaran bagaimana implementasi soft power dijalankan oleh Amerika Serikat, dan sudah terlihat jelas bahwa kapabilitas <em>soft power</em> Amerika Serikat juga sangat dominan jika kita melihat bagaimana pengaruh industri hiburan Negara ini di seluruh dunia. Kajian mengenai fenomena ini merupakan sebuah kajian yang menarik, terutama dikaitkan studi budaya popular dan media dalam hubungan internasional, karena fenomena <em>military-entertainment-complex</em> ini tidak hanya ada dalam industri perfilman tetapi juga dalam media hiburan lain seperti industri permainan elektronik atau <em>game</em>.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Daftar Referensi</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Buku dan Jurnal</strong><br />\r\nDerian, J.

Konflik ini bermula pada saat Inggris mengakhiri mandatnya di Palestina pada akhir perang dunia II. Dimana Inggris membagi wilayah tersebut mejadi dua bagian yaitu pertama untuk Israel mendapat 50% tanah dan Arab mendapat 42%, kedua untuk Palestina di bawah komite khusus PBB untuk Palestina (<em>United Nations Special Committee on Palestine</em>/UNSCOP) sedangkan sisanya termasuk Yerusalem memiliki zona internasional yang disahkan melalui resolusi PBB 181 pada tahun 1947 tetapi Arab menolak resolusi tersebut sedangkan Israel menerima. Hal ini menyebabkan kedua pihak saling berperang yang di menangkan oleh Israel sehingga ia bisa menguasai 78% lebih tanah dari yang direncanakan yang membuat sekitar 700.000 orang Palestina mengungsi dari rumah mereka dan mencari tempat yang aman. Walaupun konflik ini masih berlangsung sampai sekarang, sebenarnya sudah banyak resolusi damai yang telah dilakukan oleh berbagai pihak misalnya pada tahun 1964 didirikan sebuah organisasi yang bernama organisasi pembebasan Palestina yang kemudian pada tahun 1974 disahkan menjadi perwakilan hukum rakyat Palestina oleh negara- negara muslim. (Ahmed F, 2018) selain itu membuat kesepakatan oslo pada tahun 1993 yang merupakan terobosan besar dalam konflik Israel-Palestina walaupun masih banyak kekurangan di dalamnya. Dalam kesepakatan tersebut PLO mengakui &ldquo;hak untuk hidup dalam perdamaian dan keamanan&rdquo; Israel dan menerima resolusi PBB 242 dan 338 sedangkan Israel setuju untuk mengakui PLO sebagai &quot;perwakilan rakyat Palestina dan memulai negosiasi dengan <em>Palestine Liberation Organization</em> (PLO) dalam proses perdamaian Timur Tengah&quot; yang membuat otoritas Palestina diizinkan untuk memerintah Tepi Barat dan Gaza untuk periode transisi tidak melebihi 5 tahun periode transisi. (Makdisi, 2018) (Salinas &amp; Rabia, 2010) namun, proses perdamaian ini gagal dikarenakan Israel yang melanggar kesepakatan yang telah dibuat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nAkhirnya banyak pihak membuat resolusi damai dengan menggunakan pendekatan diplomasi budaya yang dimana menurut Cyntia Schneider berpotensi menciptakan keunikan atmosfer keterbukaan melalui pengalaman bersama dan acara budaya. (McParland) munculah beberapa project-project perdamaian seperti pada tahun 2001 diprakarsainya <em>Football for Peace</em> di Israel Utara dengan mendirikan kamp pelatihan sepak bola untuk anak-anak Arab/Palestina dan Yahudi yang bekerja sama dengan beberapa organisasi seperti <em>World Peace Sports Project</em>, <em>German Sport University</em> (Cologne), <em>British Council</em>, Asosiasi Sepakbola Inggris dan Irlandia bahkan Otoritas Olahraga Israel. Selain itu project perdamaian yang paling terkenal yaitu <em>The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra</em> yang didirikan oleh Daniel Barenboim dan Edwar Said. Yang dimana penulis dalam paper ini akan membahas <em>West-Eastern Divan Orchestra</em> dan promosi perdamaian (Dart, 2019) (Jones, 2003)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">West-Eastern Divan Orchestra dibentuk pada tahun 1999 oleh seorang konduktor dan pianis Daniel Barenboim dan penulis serta cendekiawan Palestina almarhum Edwar Said. Dimana awal mulanya orkestra ini untuk lokakarya bagi musisi-musisi Israel, Palestina serta beberapa negara Arab yang sekarang menjadi salah satu orkestra paling terkenal di dunia yang bertujuan untuk mempromosikan kesetaraan, harmoni dan pemahaman antar musisi dengan latar belakang konflik Israel dan Palestina. Orchestra ini awalnya bekerja sama dengan <em>Weimar European Culture Capital</em> yang bertempat di Weimar, Jerman yang merupakan ibukota kebudayaan Eropa paling terkenal pada tahun itu untuk berpastisipasi pada acara Weimar. Daniel dan Edward mengatakan kerjasama mereka pada saat itu merupakan sebuah eksperimen yang paling berani karena melibatkan pemuda di negara- negara Timur Tengah yang berusia 18- 25 tahun. Selain itu, di tengah- tengah mempersiapkan lokakarya ini juga mereka berdua memiliki keraguan, apakah pemerintah Timur Tengah di beberapa negara Arab akan mengizinkan pemuda-pemuda ini hadir dalam lokakarya tersebut tetapi pada akhirnya, semua siswa benar- benar datang dan siap untuk berpartisipasi dalam lokakarya tiga minggu tersebut. Dimana dalam latihan loka karya tersebut dipimpin langsung oleh Daniel pada pagi dan sore hari serta memberikan materi kelas master dan pelajaran individu bergabung dengan pemain Cello Yo-Yo-Ma dan guru lainnya sedangkan Edward memimpin debat mengenai politik dan musik pada malam hari. Ketika lokakarya tersebut berhasil diselenggarakan mereka hanya ingin merekrut 20 musisi di luar negara Timur Tengah namun, mereka terkejut ketika yang mendaftar berjumlah lebih dari 200 musisi. Pada tahun 2002, orkestra ini menemukan rumah permanen berkat Pemerintah daerah Andalusia di Seville, yang sejak saat itu membuat banyak musisi Spanyol terlibat dalam orkestra ini. (Said.es, 2017) (Riiser, 2009)&nbsp; (Franks, 2019)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nMelalui karya dan keberadaanya Orkestra Divan Barat-Timur ini berhasil menembus dunia musik internasional dengan tampil pada berbagai konser di tempat- tempat paling bergengsi di Eropa, Asia serta Amerika. Orkestra ini juga menjadi tamu reguler di festival musik internasional utama Eropa serta pada tahun 2005 berhasil tampil dalam konser-konser bersejarah ansambel di Ramallah, Konser di Rabat, Doha serta Abu Dhabi. Pada desember 2006 mereka tampil di Aula Majelis Umum Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa di New York untuk menghormati Sekretaris Jenderal Kofi Annan dan dan pada Oktober 2015 Divan Barat-Timur ini memberikan Konser untuk Memahami Kewarganegaraan dan Hak Asasi Manusia di markas PBB di Jenewa. <em>West-Eastern Divan Orchestra</em> telah menerima banyak penghargaan bergengsi atas kerja sama mereka. (Un.org, 2015) (Hall, 2018)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusik adalah salah satu media yang dapat memainkan peran penting dalam melakukaan promosi perdamaian. Berbagai warisan musik mungkin terbukti menjadi komponen penting dari upaya untuk mendukung perdamaian. Musik bisa mempengaruhi tubuh seseorang sehingga bisa membantu menumbuhkan toleransi. Selain itu juga, musik dapat digunakan untuk mempromosikan budaya perdamaian melalui berbagai media seperti festival Musik untuk perdamaian yang mungkin berdampak langsung pada komunitas tempat mereka diadakan seperti halnya yang dilakukan oleh <em>West-Eastern Divan Orchestra</em> yang berhasil menunjukkan keberhasilannya dalam merangkul pemuda-pemuda Israel dan Palestina. (Lasonen, 2003)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/xyW13WlvoxXXpU9w.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"http://elenacheah.com/book/an-orchestra-beyond-borders/\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>West-Eastern Divan Orchestra</em> ini telah berhasil menunjukkan kehebatan mereka selama 20 tahun dan memberikan warna dalam dunia musik internasional. Orkestra Divan Barat-Timur ini berhasil menunjukkan melalui karyanya bahwa jembatan dapat dibangun untuk mendorong orang untuk mendengarkan narasi yang lain. Dimana orkestra ini menunjukkan bahwa untuk menyebarkan perdamaian tidak harus melalui kesepakatan tetapi kita bisa melakukan promosi perdamaian melalui musik. Meskipun dalam perjalanannya, banyak pihak yang menyangkutpautkan orkestra ini dengan rencana politik tetapi pendirinya, Borheim mengatakan project ini murni untuk menyebarkan perdamaian di wilayah Asia Timur terutama dalam konflik Israel dan Palestina dan bukan sebagai ajang latihan politik. (Independent, 2003). Tindakan yang dilakukan oleh orkestra ini sangat mempengaruhi pespektif kita tentang konflik yang terjadi antara Israel dan Palestina khususnya masyarakat misalnya kita akan berpikir bahwa ternyata orang Palestina dan Israel bisa bekerja sama. Hal ini bisa dibuktikan dalam orkestra ini bahwa mereka bisa menghasilkan harmoni yang indah melalu musik yang mereka mainkan karena bisa menurunkan ego masing-masing. Selain itu, mereka memperlihatkan kepada negara Israel dan Palestina bahkan dunia bahwa untuk menyelesaikan masalah tidak harus menggunakan militer tetapi dengan menggunakan musik sebagai alat perdamaian mereka bisa hidup berdampingan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nBerdasarkan pembahasan diatas dapat ditarik kesimpulan bahwa musik merupakan komponen penting dalama menyebarkan perdamaian seperti yang dilakukan oleh <em>West-Eastern Divan Orchestra</em> yang bertujuan untuk mempromosikan kesetaraan, harmoni dan pemahaman antar musisi dengan latar belakang konflik Israel dan Palestina. Orkestra ini menggunakan musik sebagai alat untuk menyebarkan perdamaian dalam konflik Israel dan Palestina. Dimana ide yang dilakukan oleh <em>West-Eastern Divan Orchestra</em> sangat bagus sehingga mempengaruhi perspektif dunia baik terhadap konflik maupun masyarakatnya. Selain itu membuktikan bahwa musik bisa membuat mereka hidup berdampingan serta penggunaan militer bukan jalan satu-satunya untuk menyelesaikan sebuah konflik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">REFERENSI</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ahmed F, A.

Hal ini sejatinya telah ada sejak jaman dahulu kala. Dalam kajian Hubungan Internasional dewasa ini, perang antar negara diredam semaksimal mungkin melalui berbagai instrument seperti diplomasi, perjanjian, hukum internasional, kerjasama dan lain sebagainya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Meski banyak upaya telah dilakukan untuk meredam potensi perang antar negara, fakta yang tidak dapat dipungkiri adalah potensi perang itu pada dasarnya tetap ada. Untuk itu, negara berupaya memperkuat militernya demi menjaga dirinya dari ancaman militer negara lain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ada segelintir negara dalam jumlah yang kecil yang mampu memperkuat militernya di atas negara-negara lain. Kekuatan militernya dilengkapi dengan senjata nuklir yang dikenal sebagai senjata mutakhir. Banyak yang menganggap senjata ini menjadi &lsquo;garansi&rsquo; memenangkan perang. Ada pula kelompok negara yang memiliki militer tidak terlalu kuat. Hal ini mengakibatkan mereka berada dalam posisi yang relatif lebih lemah jika dibandingkan dengan negara dengan militer yang lebih kuat dan dilengkapi dengan persenjatan nuklir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Konflik dan Potensi Perang</strong><br />\r\nPerbedaan kekuatan militer, dalam hal tertentu, menentukan bagaimana negara bersikap satu sama lain. Perbedaan dalam cara bersikap ini juga ditunjukkan ketika menghadapi konflik/konfrontasi dengan negara lain. Negara-negara dengan kekuatan militer yang kuat biasanya lebih agresif ketika konfrontasi dengan negara lain yang secara kapasitas militer di bawahnya. Sedangkan negara yang militernya lebih lemah, biasanya lebih memilih upaya diplomatis dalam peyelesaian sengketa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Hal ini kurang lebihnya dapat dilihat dari beberapa kejadian yang baru-baru ini terjadi. <em>Pertama</em>, konflik bersenjata di perbatasan antara China dan India. Dua negara ini terlibat konflik bersenjata yang mengakibatkan sekitar 20 orang tentara India tewas dalam insiden di perbatasan kedua negara tersebut&nbsp; (Gettleman, 2020).&nbsp; China telah beberapa kali terlibat ketegangan terkait perbatasan, termasuk ketegangan di Laut China Selatan yang melibatkan beberapa negara di Kawasan Asia Tenggara, termasuk Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nAksi agresif China ini dapat dipahami jika melihat kapasitas militer yang dimiliki memungkinkan China untuk bersikap agresif&nbsp; (Aljazeera, 2020). Pada dasarnya perbedaan militer antar kedua negara tidak terlalu terpaut jauh&nbsp; (Globalfirepower, 2020). Meski demikian, India tampaknya lebih memilih untuk menahan diri dan paham bagaimana harus bersikap dalam menghadapi hal ini&nbsp; (bbc, 2020).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/OCA470EHftRz-wZF.jpg\" style=\"height:261px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/stegoceras/art/An-unequal-fight-161033110\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Kedua</em>, konflik antara Korea Utara dan Selatan. Korea Utara meledakkan kantor yang menjadi penghubung dengan Korea Selatan. Hal ini diambil setelah Korea Utara kecewa dengan sikap yang ditunjukkan oleh Korea Selatan terkait sanksi yang diberikan oleh US terhadap Korea Utara. Selain itu Korea Utara juga marah terhadap Korea Selatan yang membiarkan propaganda memasuki wilayahnya menggunakan balon ataupun drone&nbsp; (Bicker, 2020). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Korea Utara memiliki reputasi yang bagus sebagai negara yang agresif dan susah diatur. Meski demikian, kepemilikan senjata nuklir agaknya memberikan kepercayaan yang signifikan kepada Korea Utara terkait kapasitas militernya jika dibandingkan dengan Korea Selatan. Korea Selatan masih harus bergantung kepada US untuk perlindungan yang lebih besar dari ancaman senjata militer Korea Utara. Meski pada dasarnya secara hitung-hitungan kekuatan Korea Selatan relatif di atas Korea Utara&nbsp; (Globalfirepower, 2020), dalam hal ini Korea Selatan harus lebih mampu menahan diri dari agresifitas&nbsp; (Berlinger, 2020) Korea Utara dengan bayang-bayang senjata nuklirnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Alasan Menahan Diri</strong><br />\r\nBagi masyarakat awam, mungkin akan bertanya-tanya mengapa negara itu tidak membalas perlakuan buruk negara lain yang telah merugikan negaranya? Penting untuk dipahami bahwa perang pada dasarnya membutuhkan sangat banyak sumber daya, tenaga dan tentunya modal. Negara butuh alasan yang sangat kuat atau kondisi yang <em>emergency</em> untuk menguras semua hal tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPerang, dalam konteks menyerang, membutuhkan perhitungan yang jelas seperti modal yang harus dikeluarkan dan apa yang akan didapat dari perang tersebut. Besarnya modal yang dibutuhkan untuk berperang tidak memungkinkan negara untuk berperang terus menerus tanpa ada tujuan ataupun hasil yang didapat dari perang tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPerang, dalam konteks bertahan, memerlukan analisis berapa kuat kapasitas militer dan berapa lama <em>durability</em> yang dimiliki negara untuk menahan serangan sampai kemudian menyatakan kalah/menyerah dalam perang tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nBaik menyerang maupun bertahan, perang tetap saja berpotensi membawa kehancuran. Untuk itu, menghindari perang dengan cara berunding ataupun menahan diri dari melakukan serangan sia-sia sama saja dengan menghindari kehancuran. Kehancuran ini akan memiliki imbas ke berbagai sektor kehidupan masyarakat seperti politik, ekonomi dan sosial budaya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<strong>Penutup</strong><br />\r\nKeberlangsungan hidup negara erat kaitannya dengan keputusan yang diambil oleh pemimpin dan rakyat di negara tersebut. Terkadang, perang dapat &lsquo;dimenangkan&rsquo; dengan cara menahan diri atau menghindar. Karena dengan demikian, maka alasan untuk tetap hidup dan selamat dari kehancuran yang lebih besar dapat dihindari. Bukankah <em>survival</em> adalah tujuan dasar dari suatu negara?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Bahan Bacaan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Aljazeera (2020, June 20th).

(52,25,1,'Perang Teknologi 5G Tiongkok vs Amerika Serikat dalam Politik Global Kontemporer','',NULL,'<p style=\"text-align:center\">Penulis: Adi Joko Purwanto, S.IP., M.A</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">(Dosen Hubungan Internasional Fakultas Ilmu Sosial dan Politik Universitas Wahid Hasyim Semarang)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Di tengah pandemi global Covid-19 terselip cerita dibaliknya yaitu rivalitas Tiongkok dan Amerika Serikat. Kedua negara saling tuduh tentang pandemi tersebut. Tiongkok mengatakan virus tersebut dibawa oleh tentara Amerika Serikat yang mengikuti perlombaan militer di Wuhan, Tiongkok. Sedangkan Amerika Serikat menyebutnya virus <em>china flu</em> yang bocor dari sebuah laboratorium di Wuhan. Hal tersebut menunjukan rivalitas kedua negara tersebut masih berlangsung yang sebelum wabah global covid 19 terjadi yaitu perang dagang diantara keduanya. Dalam opini ini penulis mencoba untuk fokus pada rivalitas kedua <em>big power</em> yang telah berlangsung sejak lama bahkan akan berlanjut sampai beberapa dekade kedepan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mungkin tidak banyak diketahui oleh awam bahwa saat ini di tengah pandemi Covid-19 global keduanya juga sedang bertarung dalam industri teknologi 5G. Inilah yang akan coba penulis sampaikan. Perlu di catat saat penulis mendapat kesempatan berkunjung ke Tiongkok atas undagan <em>ministry of commerce</em> P.R. China untuk mengikuti seminar <em>Belt and Road</em> tahun 2019. Penulis melihat Tiongkok sudah &lsquo;khatam&rsquo; soal industri teknologi 4G ini dibuktikan mereka sudah mulai menjual ponsel dengan teknologi 5G. Jaringan 4G di beberapa kota besar sampai ke pelosok desa, kereta bawah tanah atau penyebrangan bawah jalan (<em>tunnel</em>) jaringan 4G selalu <em>On</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rivalitas dua negara besar Amerika Serikat dan Tiongkok telah berlangsung sejak tahun 1950-an dengan pertarungan ideologi liberalisme yang diwakili Amerika Serikat dan komunisme oleh Tiongkok menjadi awal dari rivalitas. Hubungan keduanya diwarnai propaganda Perang Dingin, embargo perdagangan, dan kebisuan diplomatik. Perang Korea pada tahun 1950 menjadi bukti rivalitas Amerika Serikat dan Tiongkok. Berakhirnya perang dingin tahun1990-an telah merubah peta konstelasi politik internasional hingga memasuki era milenial tahun 2000-an corak rivalitas antar negara pun mengalami perubahan tidak lagi mengandalkan kekuatan militer dan ekonomi tetapi mulai merambah pada kekuatan teknologi. Terdapat sebuah keyakinan dari negara-negara maju dan besar seperti Amerika Serikat dan Tiongkok bahwa pertarungan masa depan dunia akan bergeser dalam pertarungan teknologi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kalau pada abad 16 &ndash; 18 siapa yang menguasai lautan maka akan menjadi penguasa dunia dan Kerajaan Inggris Raya telah menjadi bukti pada waktu itu sebagai penguasa dunia diikuti Perancis, Spanyol, Portugal dan Belanda. Maka pada masa depan siapa yang menguasai teknologi maka akan menguasai dunia dan menjadi negara yang <em>survive</em> dalam pertarungan politik internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saat ini rivalitas Amerika Serikat dan Tiongkok secara tidak langsung telah mengalami pergeseran kearah pertarungan dan penguasaan tekonologi salah satunya industri teknologi 5G. Hal ini sangatlah wajar (karena) ketergantungan dunia terhadap teknologi sangat kuat dari level individu sampai ke level negara. Dikutip dari beberapa sumber teknologi internet 5G adalah generasi terbaru dari jaringan internet, yang menjanjikan konektivitas dan kecepatan unduhan 10 hingga 20 kali lebih cepat daripada kecepatan internet yang tersedia sekarang serta pengunggahan data yang jauh lebih cepat, jangkauan yang lebih luas dan koneksi yang lebih stabil. Dan kedepan seluruh dunia akan menggunakan teknologi tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/M08N025z4A5u9lwd.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/03/15/the-battle-for-digital-supremacy\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tiongkok dan Amerika Serikat saat ini tengah dalam&nbsp; perlombaan untuk mengembangkan dan menyebarkan jaringan teknologi komunikasi 5G dunia. Tiongkok telah berupaya untuk mendominasi secara global dalam teknologi ini, dan Amerika Serikat baru sadar akan kenyataan bahwa mereka berada dalam persaingan yang serius dan Amerika Serikat sementara jauh tertinggal dari Tiongkok.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saat ini Perusahaan Tiongkok seperti Huawei sangat progresif dalam pengembangan industry 5G bahkan sebagian besar komponen ponsel yang ada di dunia saat ini adalah buatan pabrikan Huawei. Hal tersebut menjadi ancaman serius Amerika Serikat sebagai negara yang tidak ingin kehilangan pengaruhnya di dunia internasional siapa pun yang memimpin dalam sektor ini secara global kemungkinan akan memimpin di banyak sektor lain di masa depan. Hal lain yang menjadikan ini sangat penting sekali bagi negara Paman Sam adalah karena Teknologi ini adalah tulang punggung dari Revolusi Industri 4.0. Dan akan menjadi landasan untuk mengembangkan apa yang dulunya merupakan fiksi ilmiah seperti mobil yang dapat mengendalikan diri, rumah dan kota pintar, operasi jarak jauh, manufaktur otonom, realitas virtual canggih, dan banyak inovasi lainnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kontestasi industry teknologi 5 G sebagai penopang revolusi industri 4.0 adalah kompetisi strategis besar dan Tiongkok saat ini berhasil melalui jagoannya, Huawei. Raksasa telekomunikasi ini telah secara agresif berusaha membangun jaringan 5G di seluruh dunia dengan bantuan subsidi besar dari pemerintah Tiongkok. Huawei telah beroperasi di 170 negara (melalui kontrak 4G yang ada dan kontrak 5G yang baru). Sementara itu, perusahaan telekomunikasi utama AS hampir tidak memiliki kehadiran 5G internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bagi Amerika Serikat progesivitas yang sangat cepat Huawei dalam pengembangan teknologi 5 G tentunya menjadi sebuah ancaman. Pengenalan teknologi nirkabel 5G menjadi pintu masuk dan peluang bagi Tiongkok untuk mencapai keunggulan dan dominasi atas negara &ndash; negara lain di dunia termasuk Amerika Serikat. Jika Huawei memenangkan persaingan untuk menerapkan 5G, internet yang tahun 2030 pada saat seluruh dunia sudah menggunakan teknologi tersebut artinya 10 tahun kedepan Amerika Serikat akan kehilangan tempatnya sebagai kekuatan <em>superpower </em>serta teknologi terkemuka di dunia. Secara otomatis akan berdampat terhadapat lika-liku Amerika di seluruh dunia karena&nbsp; akan sangat terkekang oleh keberadaan sistem teknologi komunikasi yang disediakan oleh Tiongkok serta dikendalikan secara Tunggal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kedepan rivalitas Tiongkok dan Amerika Serikat masih akan terus berlanjut. Keduanya akan tetap bertahan untuk menjadi aktor penting dan saling berebut pengaruh dalam politik global. Metode persaingan keduanya pun tidak akan selalu mengandalkan kekuatan militer dan ekonomi disaat negara-negara lain melakukan hal sama yaitu penguatan di bidang militer dan ekonomi. Kebutuhan industri teknologi kedepan juga akan semakin kuat tingkat ketergantungan juga semakin tinggi wajar bila kedepan setiap negara akan berlomba menjadi pemegang paten teknologi. Karena mereka akan menjadi penguasa politik global masa depan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/gqda5s6kSk-2kKha.jpeg\" style=\"height:700px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foto: Adi Joko Purwanto</p>\r\n','','Internasional, Amerika, Perang, Tiongkok, Teknologi','072020',2,1,643,NULL,1593666000,1593669720,1607073135,1,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,653),

Dalam beberapa kasus sebelumnya seperti pandemi <em>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</em> (SARS), Jonathan Schwartz (2012) membandingkan respon Tiongkok yang non-demokratis dan Taiwan yang demokratis dengan temuan bahwa Cina memiliki keunggulan dibandingkan dengan Taiwan yang demokratis dalam mengatasi wabah. Namun ketika pandemi Covid-19 hadir dan keberhasilan Korea Selatan, Taiwan, dan Jerman memeranginya, membuktikan bahwa argumen tersebut tidak sepenuhnya benar. Dalam mengahadapi pandemi saat ini tidak menitikberatkan apa rezim yang dianut suatu negara, bisa saja sebagai negara non-demokratis seperti Cina sama berhasil dengan negara demokratis seperti Korea Selatan. Lantas muncul pertanyaan, faktor apa yang menentukan keberhasilan suatu negara dalam menghadapi wabah pandemi? Dalam menjawab pertanyaan ini, perlu menyimak pengalaman Amerika dan Inggris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nAmerika dan Inggris merupakan dua negara demokrasi terbesar tetapi nyatanya tidak berhasil dalam menangani pandemi. Melihat Amerika Serikat (AS) menurut data University Johns Hopkins dan Medicine, sudah terdapat 146,198 jiwa yang meninggal dan 4,102,002 masyarakat yang terinfeksi positif. Mengutip informasi dari Republika News (2020), menyatakan bahwa peningkatan jumlah terinfeksi di Amerika merupakan kegagalan Trump dalam menerapkan pencegahan awal di Amerika. Virus telah terdeteksi sejak Desember di Wuhan dan sejumlah Badan intelijen AS telah menyurati di awal Januari terkait potensi Virus corona, begitu juga Direktur Pengendalian Penyakit Cina secara pribadi, telah memanggil Direktur Pusat Pengendalian Penyakit AS untuk membahas terkait virus corona, sementara Penasihat Gedung Putihpun, Peter Navarro telah mengirimkan memo mendesak pada 28 Januari untuk memperingatkan kemungkinan potensi Virus, namun respon Trump baru terdegar pada saat pertemuan elit global di Alpen Swiss pada 22 Januari, itu pun Trump mengatakan bahwa virus corona hanya memiliki ancaman kecil dan Amerika dapat mengendalikannya. Sementara di Inggris menurut data Jhons Hopkins terdapat 45,501 kematian akibat corona dan 296,377 masyarakat yang terinfeksi positif. Meskipun memiliki perbedaan drastis dengan jumlah terpapar di Amerika, namun Inggris sudah termasuk kedalam sepuluh negara dengan jumlah terinfeksi covid-19 tertinggi di dunia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/gd2czzn91UiKElna.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/cartoons/2020/03/26/cartoonists-around-the-world-take-on-a-global-pandemic-000141?slide=7\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Selain memiliki kegagalan dalam merespon pandemi secara cepat, Amerika dan Inggris juga memiliki kegagalan terkait koordinasi negara dengan tim kesehatan. Melihat dari surat kabar The New York Times (2020) memuat berita-berita keresahan para pakar kesehatan terhadap Gedung Putih terkait percepatan langkah pencegahan. Dr. Anthony Fauci selaku pakar gugus tugas penanganan virus corona di AS menyatakan bahwa, timnya telah mengusung rekomendasi medis terkait percepatan penanganan virus, namun tidak terdapat pertimbangan lanjut dari pemerintah. Pernyataan tersebut di respon oleh Trump melalui laman Twittter, sebagai tanda tidak setuju dengan pernyataan tersebut dan menuliskan sebuah saran yang ditujukan kepada calon anggota Kongres dari Partai Republik untuk melakukan pemecatan terhadap Dr. Fauci.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nKenyataanya Trump dan para tim medis memiliki perspektif yang berbeda, medis menjelaskan dari segi pendekatan ilmiah terkait dampak virus dan penularannya, sementara Trump hanya berangkat dari dasar &ldquo;harapan&rdquo; bahwa Amerika mampu mengendalikan virus corona. Bahkan Fauci menyatakan bahwa banyak rekomendasi dari pihak medis namun terkadang tidak dimplementasikan. Hasilnya banyak masyarakat AS yang cenderung menolak untuk melakukan karantina, karena tidak terdapat ketegasan dari pemerintah untuk mengatur protokol kesehatan terkait penanganan virus. Selain itu Amerika merupakan wilayah yang luas dan untuk menjangakau semua wilayah membutuhkan kerjasama dari pemerintah untuk mendukung, melimpahkan dan mempercayai otoritas medis sebagai tim garda depan akibatnya merosot legitimasi otoritas medis sehingga menimbulkan krisis kepercayaan publik. Begitu juga di Inggris, otoritas medispun sangat lemah hal ini terbukti, Perdana Menteri Boris Johnson, mengambil kebijakan yang &ldquo;ugal-ugalan&rdquo; dengan menerapkan <em>herd immunity</em> yang ternyata belum teruji secara ilmiah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nJika dibandingkan kedua negara dengan lainnya, misalnya Singapura sudah sejak per 3 Februari 2020 melalui menteri kesehatan, Singapura sudah mengumumkan di parlemen bagaimana menghadapi pandemi. Hasilnya jika dibandingkan dengan Amerika dan Inggris, Menurut data Kementrian Kesehatan Singapura (MOH) terdapat 30.426 masyarakat yang terinfeksi positif sementara angka kematian Singapura memiliki di bawah lima kematian per 1 juta sama halnya dengan Korea Selata. Korea Selatan juga termasuk negara yang memiliki respon yang cepat dan memiliki koordinasi baik dengan tim medis, seminggu setelah ditemukan kasus pertama, keluar perintah 20 perusahaan memproduksi alat tes secara cepat dan dilanjutkan dengan tes massal. Begitu juga dengan Vietnam sebagai negara yang berhasil mencegah pandemi. Vietnam memiliki respon yang cepat, setelah terdegar virus bermunculan di Wuhan, Vietnam dengan cekatan memerintahkan tim medis untuk melakukan tes massal, hasilnya sejak awal pandemi sudah ditemukan dua terinfeksi dan berhasil ditangani oleh tim medis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nMelihat angka terpapar yang terus meningkat, bukan hanya negara yang sedang bekerja keras memerangi virus tersebut namun selaku Organisasi Kesehatan Dunia (WHO) juga turut berupaya melawan pandemi virus. Menurut Senior on Gender and Youth to the WHO DG (2020), menyebutkan bahwa sejak pertama virus corona menyebar, WHO telah melakukan forum diskusi online yang berjudul &ldquo;Peran Masyarakat Sipil Hadapi Covid-19&rdquo;, yang harapanya seusai diskusi tersebut, negara-negara dapat menemukan <em>goal setting</em> nasional dalam memerangi pandemi. Menurut Beliau terdapat hal penting yang ditegaskan oleh WHO bahwa negara-negara harus melakukan berbagai cara dengan tujuan utama menyelamatkan jiwa (<em>saving lives</em>) dan <em>speed</em> atau kecepatan aksi dalam menghadapi pandemi. WHO menjelaskan bahwa, negara tidak akan berhasil jika diibaratkan berpacu dengan kecepatan penyebaran virus, maka negara harus lebih cepat untuk bisa membendung lajunya penyebaran virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/De-oDrrrC9XXZ12e.jpeg\" style=\"height:210px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://pari.org.za/this-months-cartoon-2/\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Terdapat tiga poin penting yang menjadi rekomendasi WHO terhadap negara-negara yaitu, <em>pertama</em> pembuat kebijakan harus menjadikan kesehatan masyarakat menjadi prioritas utama. <em>Kedua</em>, persoalan mitigasi harus transparan dan memiliki tingkat kepercayaan publik yang tinggi dan <em>ketiga</em>, dibutuhkan kesatuan solidaritas kolektif pemerintah dan masyarakat sipil dalam menentukan aksi. Menurut WHO penerapan ketiga langkah tersebut, menjadi tolak ukur keberhasilan negara dalam memerangi pandemi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPernyataan tersebut dapat dibuktikan dengan keberhasilan Korea Selatan meredam lajunya virus corona. Berdasarkan data CSSE Johns Hopskin University pada April jumlah kasus positif corona di Korea Selatan tercatat sebanyak 10.284 pasien dengan angka kematian cukup rendah yakni, 186 jiwa, sementara pasien yang berhasil sembuh sebanyak 6.598 jiwa. Keberhasilan Korea Selatan meredam angka kematian dan memiliki jumlah kesembuhan yang tinggi mendapat apresiasi dari WHO yakni, Direktur Badan Kesehatan Dunia Tedros Adhanon menyebutkan terdapat 4 negara salah satunya Korea Selatan yang dinilai memiliki pengalaman yang patut menjadi teladan. Duta besar Chang-Beom menjelaskan empat strategi utama yang dilakukan pemerintah Korea Selatan dalam menghadapi pandemi yakni; pertama, melakukan tes secara agresif, kedua pelacakan kontak (<em>tracing</em>) atau mencari siapa saja yang terjalin kontak dengan pasien positif, ketiga perawatan pasien secara intensif dan yang keempat, meningkatkan partisipasi masyarakat sipil dan transparansi. Dalam penjelasan Dubes tersebut, transparansi dan kepercayaan publik yang tinggi terhadap pemerintah menjadi aspek penting dalam mendukung langkah pencegahan virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/u2C5_p0dMDw\" width=\"300\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2C5_p0dMDw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDari pemaparan diatas dapat ditarik garis besar bahwa, negara-negara yang berhasil menghadapi pandemi ditandai dengan pertama, kepemimpinan politik yang responsif. Kedua, otoritas medis disertai dengan kebijakan kesehatan publik (<em>public health policy</em>) yang memadai. Ketiga, terdapat kesadaran dan partisipasi masyarakat sipil yang tinggi. Bagaimana dengan Indonesia? Dalam menangani Covid-19, Pemerintah Indonesia banyak mendapat kritik karena dinilai oleh beberapa pihak lamban dalam mengambil keputusan dan kurang transparansi data yang dirilis ke publik, serta dipandang sebagai salah satu negara yang memiliki kinerja paling buruk dalam mengatasi Covid-19 jika dibandingkan dengan negara lainnya di ASEAN. Modal terbesar yang diperlukan sejatinya adalah bagaimana mentransformasikan masyarakat sipil menuju kesadaran dan solidaritas kolektif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Berdasarkan pengalaman negara-negara yang relatif berhasil mengatasi pandemi, maka terdapat tiga syarat yang diperlukan Indonesia. <em>Pertama</em>, kepemimpinan instrumental (<em>instrumental leadership</em>) yang responsif. <em>Kedua</em>, dalam mendukung kepemimpinan yang responsif Indonesia harus memperkuat legitimasi otoritas medis. <em>Ketiga</em>, supaya kebijakan medis didukung masyarakat, maka pemerintah harus berhasil membangun kesadaran dan rasa saling percaya sekaligus mendorong partisipasi publik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nNamun sejauh ini, masyarakat sipil justru mengambil peran lebih maju jika dibandingkan dengan langkah-langkah negara. Pada bulan Maret tahun 2020, terdapat koalisi masyarakat sipil yang terdiri dari AJAR, Kontras Lokataru, Migrant Care, LBH Masyarakat, PKBI, YLBHI, YLKI dan WALHI menyerukan kepada pemerintah untuk memperbaiki respon yang dinilai jauh dari pemenuhan hak untuk melindungi warga negara. Selain itu, komunitas masyarakat sipil yang berkecimpung dalam bidang keagamaan yaitu, Nahdlatul Ulama dan Muhammadiyah bergerak membentuk gugus tugas penanggulangan Covid-19 dengan mengarahkan produsen untuk memproduksi masker dengan jumlah besar dan dibagikan secara gratis terhadap masyarakat, memberikan bantuan pangan ketika pemerintah belum bergerak dan memberikan eduksasi tentang protokol kesehatan terhadap masyarakat. Kontribusi yang hampir sama juga dilakukan oleh figur publik seperti para artis dan <em>influencer</em> yang memberikan donasi berupa pemberian masker, APD dan makanan gratis terhadap masyarakat yang membutuhkan. Terdapat juga kelompok masyarakat sipil kecil yang melakukan pengalangan dana secara daring dan digital. Komunitas ini memiliki kepekaan untuk memfasilitasi publik memperoleh hak informasi tentang Covid-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDibalik sibuknya pemerintah menghadapi ancaman dan kekhawatiran krisis ekonomi, peran masyarakat sipil menjadi diperlukan untuk membangun kesadaran dan solidaritas kolektif.&nbsp; Ada tiga alasan yang mendasari argumentasi ini. Pertama, masyarakat sipil adalah kekuatan fundamental dalam mengawal kebijakan negara, kepentingan dan hak publik. Kedua, masyarakat sipil adalah aktor alternatif yang dapat berperan dalam menata ketidakteraturan kebijakan publik. Disamping itu, masyarakat sipil juga dapat menjadi alat kontrol terhadap parlemen yang justru memanfaatkan kesempatan membahas Undang-Undang kontroversial seperti Omnimbus Law dan KUH ketika perhatian masyarakat teralihkan akibat Covid-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDari pemaparan di atas dapat disimpulkan bahwa meningkatnya kasus penularan Covid-19 antara lain disebabkan oleh pertama, pemerintahan yang kurang responsif dalam menghadapi wabah sejak dini dan lemahnya implementasi kebijakan darurat dalam bidang kesehatan. Kedua, kelompok dan kekuatan masyarakat sipil dicurigai secara politis sebagai anti tesis negara, sehingga memiliki keterbatasan untuk mengawal kebijakan dan mengambil peran bersama pemerintah (solidaritas kolektif).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/UcADsqDAv9iH1vqI.jpeg\" style=\"height:211px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foto: Rivelda Pricilia Heatubun</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Daftar Pustaka</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artikel jurnal<br />\r\nAris Mundayat, Pitra Narendra, Budi Irawanto.

Kegagalan itu mungkin karena saya telah membagi judul secara spesifik berdasar tiga peminatan di HI UB saat itu (<em>International Security and Peace</em>, <em>International Political Economy</em>, dan <em>Social and Cultural Development</em>) untuk sekitar sepuluh dosen kami saat itu. Rupanya membagi habis judul secara spesifik itu agak membebani bagi kolega dan membatasi mereka.

Proses percetakan agak terhambat juga karena toko buku tutup sehingga penerbit <em>wait and see</em> menunda proses produksi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Untuk mengatasi kebosanan masa pandemi dan WFH, saya dan dosen lain (Muhaimin Zulhair Achsin) di kelompok riset yang sama, yakni HI non-tradisional, berupaya mendorong kembali penulisan buku untuk kebutuhan bahan mata kuliah &ldquo;Globalisasi dan Dinamika Lokal&rdquo; yang merupakan mata kuliah wajib di HI UB. Belajar dari kegagalan buku sebelumnya, maka kami membebaskan tema dan judul tulisan. Kami cuma memberi pagarnya: tentang glokalisasi. Bahkan hingga mendekati naik cetak, kami cuma menyampaikan ke pihak penerbit bahwa judulnya sementara ini &ldquo;Glokalisasi&rdquo;. Baru setelah kami membaca semua naskah tulisan yang masuk untuk penulisan kata pengantar dan kata penutup buku, muncul gagasan untuk menambahkan sub-judul, &ldquo;Gerakan Sosial, Kewargaan, dan Komunitas Lokal&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>hi.id: Di dalam buku ini anda menulis &ldquo;Untuk bertahan dari turbulensi global (yang disebabkan oleh pandemi), opsi glokal (globalisasi dan lokalisasi) tampak menjanjikan sebagai bagian dari ikhtiar reformasi struktural&rdquo;. Tolong jelaskan maksud kalimat yang anda tulis ini!</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nY.E:<br />\r\nCoba apa yang kita lakukan saat mengalami turbulensi hebat saat di ketinggian udara, di sebuah pesawat terbang? Kembali ke kedirian kita. Satu-satunya yang bisa kita kontrol ya cuma diri kita. Kita mungkin berharap pilot bisa mengendalikan situasi. Tapi kita juga sepenuhnya tahu bahwa dalam batas tertentu, pilot pun tak bisa melawan takdir Tuhan atas apa yang terjadi. Kita kembali ke diri kita. Kita berdoa. Percaya pada diri dan keyakinan kita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Jika pandemi adalah turbulensi global, kita tak bisa mengontrolnya. Hingga detik ini, vaksin belum diproduksi. Inggris dan beberapa negara lain mengklaim dalam proses mengembangkan vaksin anti-virus dan akan mempoduksinya akhir tahun ini atau tahun depan. Kita? Hingga kini belum mampu memproduksi vaksin, dan sepertinya nanti akan kembali menjadi konsumen pabrikan farmasi global. Meski di negeri kita ada &ldquo;kalung anti-Corona&rdquo;, kita tahu itu tak lebih dari dagelan. Maka jika kita tak bisa mengendalikannya, yang realistis ialah mengendalikan apa yang mampu kita kendalikan: kondisi dan sumber daya lokal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pandemi telah melumpuhkan ekonomi global, tapi kita harus ingat bahwa ekonomi lokal tetap bisa hidup di tengah keterbatasan. Kita bisa belajar dari bank mikro-kredit pedesaan Indonesia yang tak terguncang saat krismon 1997 atau Iran yang makin kreatif dan mandiri setelah 41 tahun didera sanksi ekonomi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Poin yang ingin saya sampaikan ialah bahwa penguatan struktur domestik merupakan keniscayaan karena kita akan mengalami apa yang disebut The Economist sebagai &ldquo;<em>slowbalisation</em>&rdquo;, perlambatan ekonomi global. Seiring dibukanya lagi aktivitas ekonomi secara bertahap, kegiatan ekonomi global akan kembali berjalan. Hanya saja kita tak bisa berharap kembali pulih seperti sediakala dengan cepat. Beberapa negara mungkin tergoda untuk membatasi pergerakan komoditas dan modal keluar negaranya.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Namun, pandemi ini kembali mengingatkan kita bahwa kita tak sepenuhnya bisa global dan tak lagi seutuhnya lokal. Persoalan global membutuhkan aksi global. Sementara ini, cara pandang tradisional soal keamanan masih mengedepankan keamanan nasional. Di tengah pandemi, kita pun melihat komedi: tiap negara berlomba-lomba menjadi penemu dan produsen vaksin anti-virus Corona. Perdana Menteri (PM) India pun mulai menebar propaganda ke bangsanya bahwa era ekonomi berdikari telah datang. Sebagai masyarakat global, kita sedang diuji untuk tidak tergoda melakukan apa yang disebut oleh analis geopolitik asal India, Dhanasree Jayaram, sebagai &ldquo;kompartementalisasi ancaman dan respon&rdquo;. Menyelesaikan ancaman global secara parsial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Godaan kita sebagai negara ialah berkejaran dengan waktu menyelesaikan masalah pandemi dengan meningkatkan tingkat kesembuhan korban pandemi di negara kita sendiri, memproteksi warga, sekaligus memulihkan ekonomi nasional untuk menghindari resesi. Penemuan vaksin anti-virus tak hanya bisa meningkatkan tingkat kesembuhan warga negara, tapi juga terkait dengan prestis bangsa dan keuntungan finansial sebuah negara. Tantangan kita ialah menemukan proporsi yang pas antara penguatan struktur domestik sembari berkontribusi dalam upaya bersama negara lain menanggulangi persoalan global seperti pandemi Korona dan pelambatan ekonomi. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<em><strong>hi.id: Apakah menurut anda civil market seperti koperasi di Indonesia dapat maju berkembang di masa pandemi dengan memanfaatkan kelesuan ekonomi global?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Y.E:<br />\r\nSaya optimis jika koperasi Indonesia kukuh menjalankan ideologi dan merawat pasarnya, <em>civil market</em>-nya, dan juga tidak diintervensi berlebihan seperti lewat pengerdilan koperasi melalui regulasi dan monopoli pengelolaan lewat Dekopin, ia sebagai institusi dan <em>civil market</em>-nya bisa maju berkembang dengan baik. Apalagi jika pemerintah <em>ajeg</em> dan <em>jejeg</em> (istikamah) memenuhi amanat konstusi menjadikan koperasi sebagai soko guru perekonomian nasional. Contohnya sederhana, perhatikan bagaimana sebagian warga subsisten memenuhi kebutuhannya saat pandemi lewat <em>urban farming</em> atau <em>urban gardening</em>. Terputusnya mata rantai suplai global akibat pandemi membuat beberapa kebutuhan dapur&mdash;terutama produk impor&mdash;menghilang dari pasar atau harganya melambung tinggi. Buah lemon, misalnya, yang selalu mengandalkan impor dari China atau Australia. Sempat hilang dari pasar untuk kemudian muncul kembali dengan harga sangat tinggi. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Lewat <em>urban farming</em>, berkebun di sepetak tanah milik kita sendiri, warga bisa memenuhi kebutuhannya secara lokal. Kita harus garisbawahi kata &ldquo;lokal&rdquo; karena dari bibit, proses dan media tanam, penanam, hingga proses berbagi atau pemasaran, semua dilakukan oleh warga kita. Ambil contoh yang dilakukan oleh Rara Sekar&mdash;mantan vokalis Banda Neira, kakak penyanyi Isyana Saraswati, yang ayahnya juga dosen HI Unpar, Sapta Dwikardana. Ia menggiatkan dan mengampanyekan berkebun di halaman sempit lingkungan perkotaan berkeja sama dengan Koalisi Rakyat untuk Kedaulatan Pangan (KRKP) dan Tani Center IPB. Dengan <em>urban gardening</em> ini, warga bisa sekaligus melawan sistem ekonomi kapitalistik dan globalisasi neoliberal yang bertumpu pada pola hubungan penuh ketimpangan nan ekspolitatif, individualistik, dan menguntungkan segelintir orang.&nbsp; Benar kata Rara Sekar bahwa dari <em>urban gardening</em> kita tak hanya bisa belajar bercocok tanam dan menguatkan ketahanan pangan, tapi juga memahami hubungan alam dan manusia dengan lebih baik agar kita terhindar dari krisis lingkungan. Pun krisis kemanusiaan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<em><strong>hi.id: Pandemi Covid-19 telah memberikan dampak pada ekonomi global yang kapitalistik dan profit oriented. Menurut pendapat anda, apa yang (seharusnya) dilakukan oleh civil market dengan memanfaatkan kondisi perubahan struktur di level internasional ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Y.E:<br />\r\nDi balik kisah sedihnya, pandemi ini juga menyimpan berkah. Macetnya globalisasi neoliberal dan ekonomi kapitalistik seperti yang saya tulis di buku ini, memaksa negara untuk meninjau ulang strategi dan kebijakan ekonomi-politiknya yang terlalu bertumpu pada asupan global dan tak cukup hirau pada sumber daya lokal. Jadi ada baiknya kita juga melihat sisi terang dari musibah ini. <em>Civil market</em> bisa memanfaatkan macet dan rapuhnya struktur internasional yang dipilari ekonomi kapitalistik dan globalisasi neoliberal dengan membangun sinergi kekuatan lokalis dan&mdash;tentunya&mdash;memanfaatkan sumber daya lokal. Kekuatan lokalis tidak hanya negara. Jika negara tak bisa kita harapkan kekuatan lokalis bisa dimunculkan dari sub-negara atau aktor transnasional.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Mari kita kembali pada contoh soal kemandirian lokal yang berupaya subsisten, memenuhi kebutuhan sendiri, lewat <em>urban farming</em>. Dalam ruang lingkup yang lebih besar, <em>urban gardening</em> secara mandiri dapat menjadi cara sederhana dan murah masyarakat untuk melawan tangan-tangan kekuasaan global. Kegiatan yang kelihatan remeh ini bisa menjadi gerakan sosial yang dahsyat. Apalagi kegiatan ini juga punya misi sosial: sinergi antara warga kota yang memiliki daya beli dengan produsen pangan dari warga kota kelas bawah serta misi lain, yakni penguatan solidaritas nasional dan transnasional. Lewat sebuah webinar &ldquo;Sistem dan Cadangan Pangan Komunitas di Masa Pandemi&rdquo;, muncul gerakan dari warga, <em>Buy 1 Give 1</em> yang berdasarkan prinsip <em>sabilulungan</em>, atau gotong royong sambung keperluan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/CtQp5bQwpQEAKEUh.jpg\" style=\"height:603px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Foto: Yusli Effendi, S.IP., M.A</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sekarang mari kita bayangkan bagaimana gerakan<em> urban farming</em> ini terhubung dengan koperasi warga yang mandiri, berdaulat, dan berideologi kerakyatan kuat. Apalagi, syukur-syukur, kemudian terhubung dengan jejaring koperasi warga di sesama negara Selatan. Sepertinya ketahanan pangan dan ketahanan ekonomi komunitas yang terwadahi dalam koperasi tidak akan menjadi &ldquo;mimpi yang kelamaan&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Hal yang sama juga saya cermati sedang dilakukan oleh mas Virtuous Setyaka, dosen HI Unand, yang menggagas Koperasi Mandiri Dan Merdeka (KMDM) di Padang. Ia layak kita berikan kredit untuk menjadi inisiator koperasi penghubung antara produsen pangan kelas bawah di kota dan desa dengan konsumen kelas menengah-atas di perkotaan sembari mengedukasi pelestarian lingkungan.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><strong>hi.id: Apa yang ingin anda sampaikan kepada masyarakat umum maupun penstudi Hubungan Internasional melalui buku ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Y.E:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sederhana saja: tetap berbahagia, berdoa dan berkarya di masa tirakat seperti saat pandemi ini.

Apa yang disebut sebagai &ldquo;perdamaian dunia&rdquo; itu sendiri belum mencapai konsensus tertentu&nbsp; mengenai&nbsp; definisi&nbsp; dari&nbsp; konsep&nbsp; tersebut, maupun pendekatan&nbsp; seperti&nbsp; apa&nbsp; yang&nbsp; harus digunakan&nbsp; untuk&nbsp; mencapainya. Penulis&nbsp; sendiri&nbsp; mendefinisikan&nbsp; perdamaian&nbsp; berdasarkan&nbsp; perspektif Johan&nbsp; Galtung (2013, 173-178) mengenai <em>Positive Peace</em> yang secara umum menyatakan bahwa perdamaian merupakan sebuah kondisi di mana tidak hanya terdapat ketiadaan kekerasan langsung (pembunuhan, pemukulan, kontak senjata), kekerasan struktural (diskriminasi kelompok, pengabaian hak dasar oleh negara), dan kekerasan kultural (praktik pingitan, kasta), melainkan juga terbentuknya kohesi sosial seperti terbentuknya rasa toleransi dan kerjasama dalam masyarakat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Definisi perdamaian dunia di atas kemudian menimbulkan pertanyaan lanjutan, lantas siapakah pihak yang memiliki peran terbesar&nbsp; untuk mewujudkan konsep tersebut? Setidaknya terdapat dua arus pemikiran yang mencoba menjawab pertanyaan tersebut, kelompok&nbsp; tradisional (yang menurut penulis mengacu pada konsep kontrak sosial Hobbesian) dan kelompok liberal (yang menurut penulis mengacu pada konsep John Locke mengenai kontrak sosial) (Prasetyawan &amp; Ulfa, 2015: 16).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Kelompok tradisional menitikberatkan pada peran negara sebagai aktor yang berperan paling penting dalam upaya mencapai perdamaian dunia. Hal ini sejalan dengan paradigma tradisional HI yang menempatkan negara sebagai aktor utamanya. Hobbes sendiri menempatkan negara sebagai leviathan yang bertugas mencegah terjadinya <em>omnium contra omnes</em> (semua lawan semua), atau yang dapat dikatakan sebagai konflik sipil; setidaknya begitulah kondisi idealnya (Prasetyawan &amp; Ulfa, 2015:16).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/h6MtsiHjJ1qho576.jpeg\" style=\"height:157px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://www.globalvillagespace.com/womens-march-fiasco-diversity-is-virtue-not-vice/\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tetapi pada praktiknya, seringkali negara justru menjadi aktor yang mendorong terjadinya konflik di dalam masyarakat. Meskipun telah dibatasi oleh berbagai peraturan perundang&ndash;undangan, tidak dapat dipungkiri bahwa negara memiliki kecenderungan untuk melakukan kekerasan, terutama jika kekerasan tersebut dilakukan untuk mempertahankan <em>state survival</em>. Dalam konteks global, kecenderungan&nbsp; ini&nbsp; menjadi lebih jelas terlihat, terbukti dengan banyaknya konflik&ndash;konflik yang dilakukan,&nbsp; atau didukung oleh negara demi mencapai&nbsp; kepentingan&nbsp; nasionalnya, sebut saja Konflik Rohingya, Persekusi Uyghur, dan Invasi Teluk&nbsp; Babi.&nbsp; Kecenderungan&nbsp; negara&nbsp; untuk&nbsp; bias&nbsp; terhadap kepentingan nasionalnya ini membuat banyak pihak (termasuk&nbsp; penulis) merasa skeptis terhadap negara sebagai aktor utama dalam upaya perwujudan perdamaian dunia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nMenanggapi perspektif kelompok tradisional di atas, kelompok liberal datang dengan sudut pandang yang lebih selaras dengan&nbsp; pergerakan Masyarakat Sipil Global (MSG). Kelompol liberal melihat peran MSG melalui sudut pandang kontrak sosial John Locke, dengan menempatkan individu sebagai aktor utama yang menentukan bagaimana negara seharusnya bertindak demi melindungi hak individu setiap warganya, yang secara tidak langsung mendukung keberadaan dan keberlangsungan MSG. (Prasetyawan &amp; Ulfa, 2015: 16)&nbsp; Rakyat yang berkelompok atas dasar kesamaan kepentingan dapat menekan dan mengawasi negara agar tidak melenceng dari mandat yang telah diberikan oleh rakyat. Sudut pandang tersebut selaras dengan posisi MSG menurut pandangan Keane (2003: 65) yang melihat MSG sebagai entitas yang terpisah dari negara dan pasar, serta menjadi kekuatan ketiga dalam struktur perpolitikan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kontemporer. MSG menawarkan inklusifitas yang lebih luas dalam pergerakannya, mencakup berbagai macam isu&ndash;isu publik, sehingga mampu merangkul kelompok minoritas sekalipun, memberikan suara kepada mereka. MSG yang digerakkan oleh rakyat&nbsp; juga memiliki jangkauan lintas kelas sehingga mampu bertindak sebagai penyeimbang kebijakan <em>top-down</em> dari negara dengan menawarkan sudut pandang akar rumput (<em>bottom-up</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Konsistensi MSG untuk terus mengupayakan tercapainya perdamaian juga dapat dilihat pada berbagai kasus dan tingkatan, mulai dari menjadi katalis terbentuknya kebijakan internasional yang mendukung terciptanya perdamaian, hingga pendampingan&nbsp; kepada&nbsp;&nbsp; wilayah&nbsp;&nbsp; dan masyarakat terdampak demi meningkatkan taraf hidup dan kesejahteraaan sosial, juga demi menciptakan kondisi sosial yang stabil terutama pada daerah yang sedang mengalami transisi pasca konflik. Sebagai contoh, The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) merupakan sebuah gerakan internasional yang dinisiasi oleh International Comitee of the Red Cross (ICRC) beserta lima organisasi lainnya pada tahun 1992 dengan misi menghentikan penggunaan ranjau darat (<em>landmines</em>) dalam pertempuran karena menimbulkan&nbsp; banyak&nbsp; kasus&nbsp; kecacatan,&nbsp; bahkan&nbsp; kematian,&nbsp; masyarakat&nbsp; sipil&nbsp; yang&nbsp; tinggal&nbsp; di&nbsp; wilayah konflik.&nbsp; Meski&nbsp; dihadapkan&nbsp; pada&nbsp; situasi&nbsp; yang&nbsp; sulit,&nbsp; namun&nbsp; ICBL&nbsp; ternyata&nbsp; mampu&nbsp; menciptakan&nbsp; riak besar&nbsp; dalam&nbsp; perpolitikan global&nbsp; yang&nbsp; berakhir&nbsp; dengan&nbsp; sukses,&nbsp; ditandai&nbsp; dengan&nbsp; Convention&nbsp; on&nbsp; the Prohibition&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Use,&nbsp; Stockpiling,&nbsp; Production,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Transfer&nbsp; of&nbsp; Anti-Presonnel&nbsp; Mines&nbsp; and&nbsp; Their Destruction pada&nbsp; 1997&nbsp; yang&nbsp; melarang&nbsp; penggunaan, penyimpanan,&nbsp; produksi,&nbsp; dan&nbsp; penjualan&nbsp; ranjau darat di seluruh dunia; pencapaian ini juga diikuti oleh penganugerahan hadiah Nobel Perdamaian kepada ICBL pada tahun yang sama (Coate, 2004: 64 &ndash; 65).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Selain berupaya menciptakan kebijakan internasional, MSG juga bergerak pada sektor akar rumput, salah satunya adalah International Women&rsquo;s Peace Service (IWPS). IWPS merupakan gerakan masyarakat sipil yang dibentuk tahun 2002 dan bergerak&nbsp; dalam&nbsp; pendampingan&nbsp; bagi&nbsp; masyarakat Palestina, terutama perempuan, yang menjadi korban dari okupasi Israel atas Palestina, khususnya di wilayah West Bank (Tepi Barat). IWPS banyak memberikan pendampingan dan pemberdayaan bagi masyarakat&nbsp; yang&nbsp; menjadi&nbsp; korban&nbsp; kebrutalan militer&nbsp; Israel, mulai dari kekerasan fisik, hingga pengambilan dan/atau pengerusakan lahan dan/atau bangunan yang dilakukan untuk mengusir paksa rakyat Palestina dari tanah mereka.&nbsp; IWPS juga menyalurkan penolakan rakyat Palestina melalui demonstrasi damai yang menolak okupasi illegal Israel atas Palestina (IWPS, 2020). Seluruh kegiatan tersebut juga didokumentasikan dengan baik, dan dilaporkan sebagai sumber literasi akademik dalam upaya memperjuangkan hak Palestina sebagai bangsa yang direnggut paksa oleh Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/vlStX-k5aPvHhAV0.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: Putra Ramadhan</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tentu kita dapat berargumen bahwa MSG tidak lepas dari bias kepentingan karena proses terciptanya&nbsp; yang&nbsp; diawali&nbsp; oleh&nbsp; diversifikasi&nbsp; kepentingan&nbsp; dalam&nbsp; masyarakat,&nbsp; tetapi&nbsp; penulis&nbsp; merasa justru&nbsp; di&nbsp; situ&nbsp; lah&nbsp; letak&nbsp; keunggulan&nbsp; lain&nbsp; dari&nbsp; MSG.&nbsp; Keberagaman&nbsp; MSG&nbsp; justru&nbsp; dapat&nbsp; menjadi&nbsp; faktor penyeimbang dari pergerakan MSG itu sendiri. Karena posisinya yang setara, dialog antar MSG dapat bebas dari bias kuasa, dan berpotensi menciptakan hasil yang lebih adil bagi masyarakat yang terlibat. Dalam konteks global, MSG juga berpotensi mengumpulkan massa lintas negara dan budaya dengan jumlah yang lebih besar, terutama pada isu yang lebih universal seperti perubahan iklim, atau dalam konteks tulisan ini perdamaian dunia, sehingga suara yang dikeluarkan memiliki kekuatan yang lebih besar dan lebih ampuh dalam mengarahkan jalannya perpolitikan dunia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">MSG sebagai kekuatan baru perpolitikan dunia berpotensi menjadi faktor penentu baru dalam perdebatan mengenai bagaimana cara mencapai perdamaian dunia. Dengan kemampuannya untuk mengumpulkan kekuatan berskala global, MSG perlahan menjadi aktor yang diperhitungkan dalam percaturan politik dunia. Tetapi, MSG tidak dapat bertindak sebagai aktor utama dalam skala global. MSG tidak memiliki instrumen &ldquo;keras&rdquo; yang dapat mewujudkan perdamaian dunia (militer, undang &ndash; undang, aliansi, dll), sehingga diperlukan kolaborasi dari keduanya dalam menciptakan diskursus yang bermanfaat sesuai&nbsp; konteks&nbsp; tulisan&nbsp; ini.&nbsp; Perdamaian&nbsp; dunia&nbsp; merupakan masalah yang&nbsp; kompleks,&nbsp; dan tentu&nbsp; tidak&nbsp; dapat&nbsp; diselesaikan&nbsp; hanya&nbsp; oleh&nbsp; mereka&nbsp; yang&nbsp; tinggal&nbsp; di&nbsp; menara&nbsp; gading.&nbsp; MSG&nbsp; menjadi penting&nbsp; bagi&nbsp; proses&nbsp; ini&nbsp; karena&nbsp; menawarkan&nbsp; sudut&nbsp; pandang&nbsp; alternatif&nbsp; yang&nbsp; lebih&nbsp; segar&nbsp; mengenai bagaimana seharusnya perdamaian dunia itu didefinisikan, dan bagaimana cara umat manusia untuk bersama &ndash; sama mewujudkannya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Referensi</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Coate, R.

Kepentingan antar negara dapat diraih melalui upaya-upaya diplomasi. Penting bagi negara untuk tetap berdiplomasi dengan negara lain. Karena dengan demikian negara dapat mempertahankan kepentingan nasionalnya atupun meraih keuntungan lainnya melalui diplomasi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Masih sejalan dengan fungsinya, diplomasi juga bisa digunakan untuk memperbaiki pencitraan suatu negara kepada masyarakat ataupun negara lain (diplomasi publik). Melalui diplomasi publik, negara dapat mencitrakan dirinya sebagai negara yang baik/bersahabat sehingga negara lain tidak perlu menganggapnya sebagai musuh. Bisa juga digunakan untuk mencitrakan sebagai negara yang maju perekonomiannya serta terbuka untuk investasi. Hal ini bisa mengundang negara lain untuk berinvestasi dan tentunya menghidupkan roda perekonomian di dalam negeri. Masih banyak lagi manfaat yang didapat melalui pencitraan yang baik. Oleh karena itu, mempertahankan citra negara di level internasional juga penting karena searah dengan mempertahankan atupun meraih kepentingan nasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Salah satu hal yang sangat sering digunakan untuk membentuk pencitraan tentang suatu negara adalah isu yang berkaitan dengan kemanusiaan. Isu ini sering digunakan untuk menjatuhkan ataupun menaikkan pencitraan suatu negara di level internasional. Pengungsi masuk dalam kategori ini. Kepedulian terhadap pengungsi bahkan sampai dimasukkan dalam perjanjian internasional untuk menghormati dan menghargai hak-hak pengungsi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tulisan pada artikel ini mencoba untuk memberikan sedikit penjelasan dari fenomena pengungsi Rohingya yang beberapa waktu lalu sempat mencuat. Mungkin, ada di benak masyarakat yang bertanya-tanya mengapa Indonesia menerima pengungsi di tengah pandemi? Silakan menyimak dan semoga bermanfaat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Isu HAM Internasional dan Diplomasi Publik</strong><br />\r\nFenomena pengungsi telah menarik banyak perhatian dari masyarakat internasional. Hal ini tidak lepas dari banyaknya pengungsi, yang karena alasan tertentu, pergi meninggalkan negara asalnya menuju negara lain yang dianggapnya lebih baik. Dalam proses perjalanannya, tak jarang pengungsi mendapatkan kendala yang menyebabkan mereka harus terdampar di negara persinggahan yang notabene bukan menjadi negara tujuan. Jika negara persinggahan tersebut meratifikasi hukum internasional terkait perlindungan terhadap pengungsi, maka wajib hukumnya bagi negara persinggahan untuk mengayomi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Secara moral, upaya untuk menampung pengungsi tentu merupakan hal yang mulia untuk dilakukan. Tapi menampung para pengungsi tidak luput dari permasalahan baru yang datang. Mulai dari dinamika sosial di masyarakat, beban kerja tambahan bagi pemerintah daerah sampai pada bantuan internasional yang terkadang tak kunjung datang. Sialnya, reputasi negara penampung terkadang menjadi tumbal di level internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/obnq3JVA-XihH6es.jpg\" style=\"height:581px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2015/09/03/commentary/world-commentary/escaping-refugee-crisis/#.XyVgIjUxXIV\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Posisi dilematis ini juga dirasakan oleh negara-negara di Eropa yang beberapa menjadi negara tujuan para pengungsi. Negara-negara Eropa yang selama ini memiliki <em>image</em> baik dan peduli terhadap isu-isu HAM di level internasional tampak tak berdaya dengan banyaknya pengungsi yang terus berdatangan. Bahkan beberapa di antara negara Eropa sampai menutup diri dan menolak pengungsi untuk masuk ke wilayah negara mereka. Beberapa contoh negara Eropa yang menolaknya adalah Polandia, Republik Ceko dan Hungaria yang dianggap melanggar hukum Uni Eropa melalui tindakan mereka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Hungaria menyatakan tidak memiliki kewajiban untuk menerima pengungsi terlepas dari apapun keputusan dari Court of Justice European Union (CJEU) atau Mahkamah Hukum Uni Eropa. Selain itu penolakan juga didasari adanya keinginan untuk &lsquo;menjaga Eropa tetap Kristen&rsquo;. Polandia beralasan penolakan terhadap pengungsi didasari kepentingan untuk melindungi dan memastikan keselamatan warga negaranya. Sedangkan Republik Ceko menyadari bahwa mereka kalah dalam kasus penolakan pengungsi sebagaimana yang diajukan oleh Pengadilan Uni Eropa akan tetapi yang lebih penting bagi mereka adalah bahwa mereka tetap tidak bersedia menerima pengungsi. Penolakan negara-negara tersebut terhadap kehadiran pengungsi pada dasarnya merupakan tekanan dari dalam (domestik). Adanya tekanan dari kelompok nasionalis membuat negara menutup diri dengan tidak menerima pengungsi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Penolakan tiga negara tersebut terhadap pengungsi dianggap melanggar hukum oleh CJEU. Hal ini dianggap tidak sesuai dengan hukum yang berlaku di Uni Eropa meskipun tidak ada denda yang diberikan kepada tiga negara itu. CJEU menganggap penolakan terhadap pengungsi tidak sesuai dengan &lsquo;<em>sharing burden</em>&rsquo; sebagai bentuk solidaritas antar sesama negara anggota Uni Eropa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Berbeda dengan negara-negara Eropa yang dijadikan sebagai tempat tujuan akhir dari para pengungsi, Indonesia lebih sebagai negara persinggahan. Pengungsi dalam perjalanannya menuju negara tujuan, karena kendala tertentu kemudian secara terpaksa singgah di Indonesia. Dengan kondisi seperti ini, Indonesia tetap memiliki kewajiban mengayomi pengungsi dengan baik sebagaimana pengungsi dari Rohingya yang beberapa waktu lalu memasuki wilayah Indonesia. Di tengah kondisi pandemi yang menyulitkan banyak pihak, tantangan lebih berat dihadapi pemerintah Indonesia dengan adanya pengungsi dari Rohingya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Indonesia memutuskan untuk menerima pengungsi tersebut untuk sementara atas dasar rasa kemanusiaan. Kondisi ini pada hakikatnya bisa membawa image positif terhadap kapasitas Indonesia sebagai negara yang memiliki kepedulian terhadap kemanusiaan. Terlebih isu kemanusiaan sedang menghangat pasca tagar <em>Black Lives Matter</em> yang dipicu oleh kekerasan rasial di AS. Di Indonesia, menghangatnya isu tersebut juga turut mencuatkan kembali isu yang relatif mirip&nbsp; seperti gerakan <em>Papuan Lives Matter</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/d5BVWpGO_v4\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5BVWpGO_v4\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Kembali ke masalah pengungsi, kebijakan yang diambil oleh pemerintah Indonesia untuk menampung para pengungsi tersebut menurut saya (secara normatif) bisa dikatakan sudah benar. Tidak hanya pencitraan keluar, masalah pengungsi ini bisa digunakan sebagai pencitraan ke dalam (domestik). Kebijakan yang diambil oleh pemerintah juga bisa menjadi kebijakan yang populis untuk membendung tekanan politik dari masyarakat/kelompok/oposisi kepada pemerintah. Kebijakan yang diambil pemerintah juga bisa dipengaruhi oleh faktor tekanan politik dan untuk meredam tekanan, pemerintah mengambil kebijakan yang sesuai dengan tuntutan tersebut. Pada level internasional, isu pengungsi ini dapat menjadi salah satu &lsquo;amunisi&rsquo; bagi diplomasi publik Indonesia. Bahkan aksi warga yang menyelamatkan dan menerima pengungsi saja sudah mendapatkan pujian dari pihak internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Meski demikian, tidak menutup kemungkinan masalah pengungsi Rohingya ini akan menimbulkan masalah baru pada tatanan sosial, ekonomi dan politik Indonesia terlebih di tengah kondisi pandemi seperti saat ini. Disaat negara sedang berhadapan dengan segala kerumitan karena Pandemi, kita justru menampung &#39;masalah lain&#39;. Tugas berat bagi pemerintah saat ini adalah meminimalisir agar permasalahan yang ditimbulkan oleh pengungsi ini tidak banyak melebar dan memperburuk kondisi domestik di tengah pandemi</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Penutup</strong><br />\r\nKebijakan menerima atau menolak pengungsi pada dasarnya memiliki keterkaitan dengan kondisi domestik. Dukungan ataupun penolakan dari masyarakat yang kemudian diekspresikan melalui perorangan/kelompok akan menjadi dasar pertimbangan bagi kebijakan yang akan diambil oleh negara. Selain karena faktor dorongan dari masyarakat (dari bawah ke atas), kebijakan juga bisa diambil berdasarkan pertimbangan dari pemerintah (dari atas ke bawah). Dalam kasus penerimaan pengungsi Rohingya, kebijakan ini selaras antara dorongan dari masyarakat serta keinginan pemerintah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Terlepas dari apakah Indonesia akan menggunakan isu pengungsi ini sebagai pencintraanya di level internasional/domestik atau tidak menggunakannya sama sekali, mempertahankan citra negara saat ini menjadi hal yang sulit untuk dilakukan. Di tengah gencarnya akses terhadap media sosial, setiap individu/kelompok/negara dapat menggunakannya untuk menjatuhkan negara lain atau menaikkan citra di level internasional. Menjadi tugas berat bagi negara maupun masyarakat untuk menjaga citranya dari di level internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Referensi</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buku:<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiSzqnIvqnrAhXu7nMBHVw-BTUQFjAAegQIBBAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unhcr.org%2F3d4aba564.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Ve24gknTItj_H9KWo18AG\">Nicholson, Frances dan Judith Kumin (2017).

Mokhamad Luthfi, M.Si.<br />\r\nDosen Tetap Program Studi Ilmu Hubungan Internasional, FISIP, Universitas Al Azhar Indonesia<br />\r\nPeneliti Pusat Studi Pertahanan dan Perdamaian (PSPP) UAI</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Editor: V S</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prolog: Epidemi dalam Buku Putih Pertahanan RI</strong><br />\r\nEpidemi atau penyebaran wabah di wilayah yang luas, merupakan ancaman nonmiliter nyata sebagaimana dinyatakan Buku Putih Pertahanan Indonesia yang diterbitkan Kementerian Pertahanan RI tahun 2015. Meluasnya penyebaran wabah Covid-19 hingga menjadi pandemi, merupakan ancaman nonmiliter sebagaimana tertulis ancaman nonmiliter lain dalam buku tersebut yaitu; bencana alam, perubahan iklim, aksi terorisme, ketahanan pangan, air, dan energi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDalam buku yang menjadi pedoman dalam kebijakan pertahanan negara tersebut, pada Bab 2 mengenai perkembangan lingkungan strategis dinyatakan bahwa &ldquo;WHO (World Health Organization) terus memberikan peringatan bahwa penyakit infeksi berbahaya bagi manusia belum sepenuhnya dapat diatasi, bahkan penyebarannya cenderung meluas&rdquo;. Selain itu, dinyatakan juga bahwa &ldquo;Ada kecenderungan bahwa penyakit infeksi pernafasan pada manusia bertambah dengan munculnya kasus-kasus baru pada populasi yang terindikasi di kawasan tertentu&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nKawasan Asia, dimana Indonesia berada, juga dinilai sebagai wilayah yang rawan terhadap munculnya berbagai penyakit berbahaya tersebut. Dengan demikian, terlihat Indonesia sudah menyadari bahwa keamanan kesehatan (<em>health security</em>) seperti terjadinya penyebaran wabah yang luas, merupakan sebuah ancaman nonmiliter nyata yang dampaknya bisa setara (atau lebih buruk) apabila dibandingkan adanya ancaman militer (perang dengan) negara lain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDalam disiplin hubungan internasional, agenda keamanan kesehatan merupakan salah satu agenda keamanan baru sebagai bagian dari perluasan agenda keamanan. Keamanan, tidak lagi dianggap hanya berasal dari ancaman serangan militer terhadap suatu negara yang disebut dengan keamanan militer atau keamanan tradisional (<em>military/traditional security</em>). Namun, tantangan keamanan juga dapat mengancam keselamatan manusia sebagai individu, kelompok, dan masyarakat dari berbagai sumber keamanan nonmiliter (<em>non-military/non-traditional security</em>) seperti bencana alam, kelangkaan sumber daya air dan energi, penyakit menular, dan sebagainya. Barry Buzan, Ole Waever, dan Jaap de Wilde dari Mazhab Copenhagen (Copenhagen School) merupakan proponen perluasan agenda keamanan ini sejak akhir dasawarsa 1990-an. Menurut Bob Sugeng (Hermawan (ed.), 2007), perluasan yang dimaksud adalah terkait dengan obyek rujukan (<em>referent object</em>) yang terancam keamanannya. Sehingga, isu keamanan bukan lagi tentang negara saja (<em>state security</em>), tetapi juga keamanan insani (<em>human security</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Sekuritisasi Yang Terlambat?</strong><br />\r\nSetelah kurang lebih enam bulan sejak WHO menyatakan Covid-19, belum terlihat tanda-tanda bahwa Indonesia memenangkan &lsquo;pertempuran&rsquo; ini. Terdapat beberapa indikator yang diantaranya adalah tingkat kematian akibat virus Covid-19 (<em>case fatality rate</em>) sebesar 4,7% yang lebih tinggi 0,8% daripada rata-rata dunia. Meskipun demikian, Indonesia bukanlah negara terburuk dalam tingkat kematian tersebut. Ada 23 negara lainnya yang lebih tinggi dari Indonesia yang beberapa diantaranya adalah negara-negara maju di Eropa Barat seperti Inggris, Perancis, Italia, dan Belanda. Selain itu, jumlah kasus baru belum juga menunjukan trend menurun. Sebaliknya, trajektori kurva terus bergerak naik. Dalam dataset di ourworldindata.org/coronavirus, bersama dengan India, Amerika Serikat (AS), Brazil, Meksiko, Kolombia, Iran, Irak, dan Filipina, Indonesia merupakan negara yang belum terlihat dapat menurunkan kurvanya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/9mj1PL3XRCgcF3VK.jpg\" style=\"height:502px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://baliexpress.jawapos.com/read/2020/07/21/205222/tuntas-pandemi-covid-pulihkan-industri-kehutanan\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Perlu diakui, tidak ada negara yang siap menghadapi krisis kesehatan pandemi Covid-19 yang dapat bergerak ke krisis ekonomi. Namun, apabila ancaman pandemi ini sejak awal menjadi perhatian serius yang diduga akan melemahkan berbagai sendi kehidupan berbangsa dan bernegara lalu membuat kita menyiapkan diri dengan sebaik-baiknya, hasilnya akan jauh berbeda. Publik masih ingat bagaimana pemerintah justru ingin mendongkrak wisatawan, manakala sudah terjadi wabah corona di berbagai negara. Padahal, yang seharusnya dilakukan adalah mengambil langkah pencegahan penularan dan penyiapan infrastruktur medis untuk mengantisipasi kemungkinan terburuk. Oleh karenanya, semakin dini persiapan yang dilakukan dan dipimpin oleh pemerintah merupakan kunci keberhasilan dalam menghadapi pandemi. Dalam hal ini, pemerintah lamban melakukan sekuritisasi untuk menjadikan isu pandemi menjadi isu keamanan yang dianggap mengancam terhadap keselamatan penduduk Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSekuritisasi secara sederhana dapat diartikan sebagai langkah <em>extra ordinary</em> menjadikan isu (nonkeamanan) menjadi isu keamanan, merupakan kerangka analisis yang dikembangkan pula oleh Mazhab Copenhagen. Buzan, Waever, dan de Wilde (Emmers, dalam Collins, 2016). Sekuritisasi bergerak dalam tiga spektrum; pertama adalah spektrum nonpolitisasi (<em>non-politicized</em>) dimana negara tidak berupaya mengatasi suatu isu, kedua adalah spektrum politisasi (<em>politicized</em>) dimana negara mengelola isu menggunakan cara-cara biasa, dan ketiga spektrum sekuritisasi (<em>securitized</em>) dimana suatu isu dilihat sebagai isu keamanan dan dinyatakan sebagai ancaman eksistensial terhadap obyek rujukan. Dinamika sekuritisasi ini memang bergantung kepada aktor sekuritisasi (<em>securitizing actors</em>) yang memiliki otoritas dalam menyatakan suatu ancaman eksistensial melalui sebuah tindak tutur (<em>speech act</em>) terhadap obyek rujukan (<em>referent objects</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSekuritisasi menghadapi ancaman nonmiliter berupa pandemi yang diklasifikasikan ancaman nyata dalam buku putih pertahanan, sistem pertahanan negara menggunakan pendekatan <em>multi agency </em>yang mengamanatkan kepada kementerian dan lembaga di luar bidang pertahanan sebagai unsur utama. Disini terlihat bahwa &lsquo;panglima&rsquo; perang melawan pandemi adalah Kementerian Kesehatan dan berbagai lembaga yang mendukung penanganan wabah terkait, seperti Badan Penelitian dan Pengembangan Kesehatan, dan lain sebagainya. Selain unsur utama, terdapat pula unsur lain yang memperkuat yaitu kementerian atau lembaga lain, pemerintah daerah, dan segenap komponen lain yang dapat memperkuat unsur utama seperti industri masker, alat pelindung diri, industri farmasi, industri vaksin, dan sebagainya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSekuritisasi isu pandemi dilakukan melalui Keppres (Keputusan Presiden) No. 7/2020 pada bulan Maret, yang kemudian direvisi oleh Keppres No. 9/2020 pada bulan April. Keppres tersebut merupakan dasar hukum pembentukan Gugus Tugas Percepatan Penanganan Covid-19. Menariknya, perbedaan kedua Keppres tersebut adalah pada Keppres pertama, tidak adanya unsur Kementerian Pertahanan baik sebagai pengarah maupun anggota pelaksana. Barulah pada Keppres No. 9/2020, Kementerian Pertahanan masuk sebagai anggota pengarah, dan unsur kementerian tersebut sebagai anggota pelaksana. Ada kecenderungan bahwa pemerintah gamang dalam menilai situasi sehingga luput memasukkan unsur Kementerian Pertahanan dalam gugus tugas. Padahal, Kementerian Pertahanan merupakan kementerian yang merumuskan, menetapkan, dan melaksanakan kebijakan pertahanan termasuk dengan kebijakan penggunaan kekuatan TNI dan komponen pertahanan lainnya untuk membantu kementerian dan lembaga dalam menghadapi pandemi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nHal yang menarik lainnya adalah bagaimana Ketua Pelaksana Gugus Tugas Percepatan Penanganan Covid-19 harus diemban rangkap oleh Kepala Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana (BNPB) yang pada dasarnya bukanlah dalam ranah kompetensi BNPB untuk menanggulangi pandemi. Meskipun epidemi atau wabah penyakit menurut UU No. 24/2007 Tentang Penanggulangan Bencana dikategorikan sebagai bencana nonalam, ketua gugus tugas bisa saja diemban oleh personil dari Kementerian Kesehatan, terutama yang memiliki kompetensi sebagai epidemiolog. Adapun unsur BNPB tetap terlibat sebagai unsur utama lain mendampingi Kementerian Kesehatan dan lembaga kesehatan lainnya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nMengingat epidemi dianggap sebagai ancaman nyata yang terus menghantui negara kita, tidak kalah penting, dukungan dan pemberdayaan bagi unsur lain seperti industri farmasi, industri vaksin, industri peralatan medis, industri alat pelindung diri, termasuk fasilitas layanan kesehatan menjadi sebuah kewajiban. Dukungan terhadap berbagai industri tersebut perlu diberikan sebesar perhatian pemerintah terhadap industri strategis negara (BUMNIS) yang menghasilkan berbagai kendaraan tempur, taktis, kapal perang, senjata api, dan alat utama sistem senjata lain yang dibutuhkan untuk menghadapi ancaman militer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nMenambahkan hal tersebut, lembaga penelitian kedokteran militer, Badan Penelitian dan Pengembangan Kementerian Kesehatan, lembaga penelitian biologi dan virus, perlu mendapatkan perhatian dalam peningkatan kapabilitas dan kapasitasnya agar semakin siap dalam menghadapi ancaman wabah. Profesi dokter dan ners serta tenaga medis lainnya perlu ditingkatkan kepakarannya menghadapi pandemi sekaligus diberi perlindungan maksimal karena merekalah para pejuang &lsquo;tempur&rsquo; dalam merawat masyarakat yang terjangkit wabah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nAdapun terkait dengan masyarakat, sebagai garda terdepan dalam menghadapi wabah, masyarakat perlu terus diedukasi mengenai ancaman wabah dan bagaimana menghadapi wabah. Tidak ada salahnya, ancaman wabah dan bagaimana menghadapinya menjadi hal yang diajarkan dalam satuan pendidikan. Diharapkan, masyarakat semakin memiliki kesadaran adanya ancaman wabah dan mengambil peran penting dalam pencegahan dan pengendalian epidemi atau pandemi. Tidak seperti sekarang, dimana sebagian masyarakat tidak mematuhi berbagai protokol kesehatan yang ditetapkan oleh pemerintah sehingga mereka abai menggunakan masker, berkerumun dan berkumpul tanpa mengindahkan physical distancing, tidak sering mencuci tangan, dan tidak menutup saat batuk atau bersin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/dAvGH_tX3E6UQnEP.jpeg\" style=\"height:450px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20200325115856-532-486749/jokowi-9-jurus-dan-kebutuhan-anggaran-rp200-t-lawan-corona\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Terkait protokol kesehatan, pemerintah seyogianya mengevaluasi dan mematangkan berbagai protokol bagaimana menghadapi wabah. Bisa saja pemerintah membuat tingkatan ancaman pandemi menjadi hijau, kuning, oranye, atau merah manakala ada potensi ancaman wabah terhadap negara. Hal seperti ini telah menjadi standar dalam kesiapsiagaan Singapura menghadapi wabah Covid-19 yang disebut dengan DORSCON (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition). Dalam tingkatan kondisi tersebut, masing-masing warna mewakili bagaimana sifat dari wabah, dampaknya terhadap kehidupan sehari-hari, dan himbauan kepada publik. Sebagai contoh, DORSCON berwarna merah bermakna wabah sangat parah dan menyebar sangat luas dalam konteks sifat alamiah wabah. Dampaknya terhadap kehidupan dalam kondisi merah bermakna adanya gangguan besar seperti penutupan sekolah, perintah bekerja dari rumah, dan jumlah kematian yang signifikan. Sedangkan himbauan terhadap publik dalam kondisi ini adalah larangan keluar rumah apabila sakit, menjaga kebersihan diri (<em>personal hygiene</em>), terus memantau saran terkait kesehatan, menaati langkah-langkah penanggulangan, mempraktikkan jarak sosial, dan menghindari area kerumunan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDi Indonesia, penggunaan kode warna dalam menilai situasi pandemi Covid-19, hanya menunjukkan zonasi sesuai dengan tingkat keparahan. Dengan zonasi seperti itu publik tidak menyadari terkait bagaimana sifat dari wabah, dampaknya terhadap kehidupan sehari-hari dan apa saja yang perlu dilakukan.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Epilog</strong><br />\r\nDari paparan di atas, Indonesia tidak terlihat cukup kuat dalam menghadapi ancaman keamanan kesehatan berupa pandemi Covid-19. Langkah yang dilakukan oleh negara di awal pandemi yang dinilai terlalu sedikit dan terlambat (<em>too little, too late</em>), membuat belum terlihat tanda-tanda pandemi akan berakhir. Kecepatan dan kesigapan menghadapi pandemi dengan multipendekatan dan pelibatan antar lembaga negara yang sudah disampaikan di atas menjadi kunci menuju upaya desekuritisasi wabah sehingga akhirnya ancaman tersebut dinilai tidak lagi mengancam. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPada akhirnya, pengalaman menghadapi pandemi Covid-19 akan menjadi pengalaman dan pengetahuan berharga bagi Indonesia. Indonesia perlu terus meningkatkan kemampuannya agar dapat mempertahankan diri dari ancaman nonmiliter, sebagaimana kita terus berlatih secara militer agar dapat menghadapi berbagai ancaman serangan militer negara lain. Di usianya yang ke-75 tahun, Indonesia perlu menjadi lebih siap dalam menghadapi ancaman krisis kesehatan yang mungkin saja terjadi kembali di masa depan sebagaimana yang sudah dinyatakan dalam Buku Putih Pertahanan RI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/hoOwQUv2LN4at5o7.jpg\" style=\"height:340px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Penulis: R.

Awalnya <em>genre</em> musik Rap hadir sebagai sarana minortitas mendapatkan tempat untuk bersuara di ruang publik. Perlu diketahui bahwa pada kala itu bahkan sampai sekarang, praktik <em>Colorism</em> di Amerika Serikat masih sedikit banyak terasa. <em>Colorism</em> atau <em>Shadeism</em>, diartikan sebagai istilah pengelompokan golongan dalam kelas tertentu berdasarkan prasangka atau anggapan terhadap warna kulit (Jones, 2000: 1448- 1556).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Praktik Colorism di Amerika Serikat dipengaruhi oleh sejarah perbudakan yang diperkirakan berlangsung sekitar 400 tahun. Dahulu bangsa penjajah datang ke benua Amerika dengan membawa budak yang Sebagian besar berasal dari Afrika. Budak yang umumnya memiliki kulit berwarna &lsquo;Hitam&rsquo; diperbudak dengan kerja paksa guna membangun kejayan negara dalam pengembangan pasar dan ekonomi. Hallease &lsquo;seorang <em>Creative Director</em>&rsquo; yang juga fokus kepada sejarah dan budaya kulit hitam beropini &ldquo;<em>We cannot run a capitalist society without free, forced or cheap labor.</em>&quot; Untuk menggambarkan bagaimana praktik perbudakan yang pernah terjadi di Amerika (Hallease, 2020).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Perilaku diskriminasi pada kulit hitam juga kerap kali tersirat dalam pop culture yang berasal dari negara Amerika Serikat sendiri, seperti dalam beberapa film. Sebut saja dalam serial Marvel berjudul &ldquo;Cloak and Dagger&rdquo; yang menggambarkan seorang anak laki-laki berkulit hitam kemudian mendapatkan banyak masalah dan menjadi pahlawan super setelah bersekutu dengan anak perempuan berkulit putih. Film lain yang juga popular berjudul &ldquo;13th&rdquo; oleh Ava DuVernay yang diproduksi Netflix, film ini menceritakan tentang amandemen negara Amerika Serikat ke 13 dan ke 14 yang dinilai timpang satu sama lainnya. Amandemen 14 dianggap bernada pembebasan budak sedangkan 13 dianggap justru memberika celah untuk perbudakan baru tetap berlangsung, contoh dari anggapan timpangnya amandemen ini adalah praktik pencabutan hak suara kaum kulit hitam jika melakukan tindakan kriminal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/B_KYOPahqwYm0IUd.jpg\" style=\"height:266px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/music/hip-hop-social-justice-intersection/\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Resah akan ketimpangan atau kesetaraan sosial yang masih terasa, musik Rap kemudian hadir dengan nada-nada &ldquo;perjuangan&rdquo; yang menyindir diskriminasi, subordinitas, perilaku rasial terhadap minoritas mencakup agama dan warna kulit. Sebut saja nama-nama besar seperti Public Enemy, Wu- tang Clan, dan Snoop Dog yang merupakan pioneer dari berbagai generasi perintis Hip-Hop dengan karya mereka yang seakan menjadi sindirian dan <em>watch dog</em> bagi pemerintah. Masa keemasan Rap sempat dianggap pudar pada 10 tahun terakhir dengan menurunnya nada-nada perjuangan yang tersirat dalam lagu-lagu yang sedang trend. Kemunculan pendatang seperti Lil Pump dengan &ldquo;Gucci Gang&rdquo; atau Lil Purp dengan &ldquo;Audy&rdquo; yang lebih identik dengan kebiasaan <em>flexing</em> atau pamer dibandingkan dengan menyuarakan keadilan semakin menguatkan anggapan ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Contoh lain adalah ketika, Kanye West seorang rapper kulit hitam yang sempat menuai kontroversi dengan &ldquo;<em>slavery for 400 years for 400 years that sound like a choice</em>.&rdquo; Ketika ditanya pendapatnya tentang isu rasialisme dan perbudakan (West, 2018). Meski begitu, Hip-Hop tetap memiliki potensi untuk merubah kondisi sosial masyarakat. Hip-Hop saat ini merupakan genre musik paling popular di Amerika Serikat, sehingga pesan &ndash; pesan perjuangan yang disampaikan melalui music Hip-Hop akan mencapai kalangan yang lebih luas, dan berpotensi memiliki dampak yang lebih besar (DJ Booth, 2019).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Meski secara umum penulis tetap berpegang teguh bahwa skema Hip-Hop sedang mengalami pergeseran nilai, namun &ldquo;api perjuangan&rdquo; Hip-Hop itu sendiri tidak pernah padam seutuhnya. Hip-Hop masih memiliki beberapa artis yang terus menyuarakan perjuangan terhadap otoritas, maupun fabrikasi budaya yang menindas kaum minoritas, terutama people of color. Jay-Z contohnya, dalam lagu &ldquo;The Story of O.J.&rdquo; beliau banyak mengkritik pergeseran budaya Amerika yang membuat etnis African-American terpecah dalam mencapai puncak strata sosial. Jay-Z mengkritik kurangnya persatuan dalam etnis African-American itu sendiri dalam menghadapi lingkungan sosial yang tidak pernah berhenti mendiskreditkan mereka sebagai <em>people of color</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Artis lainnya seperti Childish Gambino dalam lagunya &ldquo;This is America&rdquo; juga mengkritik kondisi sosial di Amerika Serikat yang digambarkan sudah seperti medan perang yang berbahaya, secara eksplisit beliau menggambarkan kondisi tersebut dengan beberapa adegan penembakan yang mewakilkan beberapa kejadian penembakan massal yang terjadi di Amerika Serikat. Childish Gambino juga mengkritisi bagaimana media kemudian digunakan sebagai alat untuk mengalihkan perhatian kita dari isu sebenarnya yang seharusnya menjadi perbincangan, salah satunya adalah diskriminasi terhadap <em>people of color</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/VYOjWnS4cMY\" width=\"800\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pengaruh musik Hip-Hop instrumen perjuangan kaum minoritas tidak hanya terasa di Amerika Serikat yang merupakan asal <em>genre</em> music tersebut. Indonesia contohnya, juga menunjukkan riak Hip-Hop yang cukup besar sebagai musik perjuangan. Artis seperti Zoonde dengan lagunya &ldquo;Poetry From Ghetto&rdquo; menjadi contoh menarik mengenai perspektif pemuda Papua dalam melihat diskriminasi dan ketimpangan yang dirasakan Papua sejak integrasinya ke dalam Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia pada 1 Mei 1963. Peristiwa seperti penyerangan Asrama Mahasiswa Papua di Surabaya pada 16-17 Agustus 2019 juga tidak lepas dari kritikan para musisi Hip-Hop, dengan artis seperti Oncho FLash dan Andho Aibah yang mengutuk keras perbuatan tersebut melalui lagu mereka yang berjudul &ldquo;Usir Papua???&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Di Tahun 2020 terdapat peristiwa yang kembali menjadi momentum bangkitnya kultur Hip-Hop sebagai gerakan masyarakat sipil global menyuarakan isu rasial dan minoritas. Peristiwa kematian George Floyd yang disebabkan oleh anggota kepolisian Minneapolis, Minnesota, Amerika Serikat yang kebetulan berkulit putih seakan membuka tabir bahwa masalah rasial dan minoritas masih terjadi. Tagar <em>Black Lives Matter</em> kemudian menghiasi media sosial internet sebagai bentuk simpati masyarakat sipil global terhadap apa yang menimpa Floyd. Keikutsertaan penyanyi Rap muda seperti Dax dengan &ldquo;BLACK LIVES MATTER&rdquo; dan Lil Baby dengan &ldquo;The Bigger Picture&rdquo; menyiratkan kebangkitan kultur rap sebagai &ldquo;New Social Movement&rdquo; sebagai sarana menyuarakan isu rasial dan minoritas di dunia. Meski penulis tidak menemukan dokumentasi mengenai keikutsertaan para musisi tersebut dalam mengorganisir gerakan protes tersebut, tetapi keikutsertaan mereka menunjukkan solidaritas, dan juga masih hidupnya &ldquo;api perjuangan&rdquo; dari music Hip-Hop dalam melawan ketidakadilan dalam masyarakat. Semoga gerakan tersebut mendorong dunia menjadi lebih baik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/Z2QRnMVK_u3Crcwb.jpg\" style=\"height:449px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Penulis: Rian Panca Kesuma</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<strong>Referensi</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">DJ Booth (2019). &quot;<em>Hip-Hop Is America&rsquo;s Biggest Genre.

(62,25,1,'“Realpolitik” Henry Kissinger dalam Fenomena Normalisasi Hubungan Israel-Uni Emirat Arab','',NULL,'<p style=\"text-align:center\">Penulis: Giftson Ramos Daniel<br />\r\nAlumni Hubungan Internasional Universitas Brawijaya Malang</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Editor: V.S</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Henry Kissinger dinilai sebagai salah satu aktor berpengaruh di Amerika Serikat (AS) yang memiliki kualitas mumpuni, dalam melakukan diplomasi dan negosiasi dengan negara lain. Penasihat Keamanan serta Sekretaris Negara pada masa Presiden Richard Nixon dan Gerard Ford ini, dikenal sebagai aktor yang memiliki pengaruh besar atas terealisasinya hubungan diplomatik antara AS dengan Republik Rakyat Tiongkok (RRT) pada tahun 1971. RRT yang merupakan salah satu kekuatan besar di Asia, dinilai mampu memberikan pengaruh yang siginifikan di kawasan Asia. Meskipun pada awalnya hubungan kedua negara bukanlah merupakan suatu hubungan yang harmonis, namun berkat kemampuan Kissinger untuk melakukan proses negosiasi dengan Mao Ze Dong, akhirnya membuat RRT bersedia menjalin hubungan diplomatik dengan AS. Keuntungan dalam berdiplomasi dengan RRT, dimanfaatkan dengan baik oleh Kissinger, untuk melakukan kesepakatan terkait upaya untuk menarik mundur pasukan militer AS dari Vietnam. Rencana ini berhasil, sehingga pasukan militer AS bisa kembali ke negaranya melalui <em>Paris Peace Accord.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPeran seorang Kissinger cukup vital terutama dalam terealisasinya kesepakatan <em>Strategic Arms Limitation Talks</em> (SALT I), yakni untuk mengontrol pengayaan nuklir Uni Soviet. Terealisasinya kesepakatan kedua negara ini, sekaligus memberikan gambaran bahwa telah terjadi relaksasi hubungan antara AS dengan Uni-Soviet. Momentum ini terlahir atas dasar kebijakan D&eacute;tente yang diinisiasikan oleh Henry Kissinger, sebagai bentuk pencegahan terhadap potensi terjadinya perang nuklir antara US dan Uni Soviet yaitu dengan cara merelaksasi hubungan kedua negara <em>superpowe</em>r dengan tujuan untuk menjaga stabilitas agar situasi dunia tetap kondusif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nHubungan antara AS sebagai negara demokrasi liberal dengan dua negara sosialis-komunis, yaitu RRT dan Uni Soviet, telah menciptakan suatu hubungan baru yang saat itu dikenal dengan sebutan <em>Triangular Diplomacy</em>. Kissinger, sebagai aktor yang berperan besar dalam realisasi hal ini, tentu memiliki strategi yang matang dalam melakukan diplomasi dan negosiasi. Kesuksesannya dalam membendung kekuatan Uni-Soviet, tidak lepas dari pengaruh konsep <em>Realpolitik</em> yang mempengaruhi Kissinger dalam proses pengambilan suatu kebijakan. Tujuan AS yang ingin menjadi negara superior satu-satunya, berusaha direalisasikan melalui konsep <em>Realpolitik</em>. Oleh karena itu untuk mencapai hal tersebut, maka nilai moral tidak menjadi prioritas utama dalam pengambilan suatu kebijakan, karena lebih berorientasi pada upaya pragmatis yang cenderung mengabaikan aspek moral, untuk mencapai suatu tujuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/AkcnNkorQk6xUjHM.jpg\" style=\"height:450px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/08/20/the-israel-uae-deal-is-good-news-for-a-troubled-region\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nKondisi serupa ternyata seolah kembali terlihat dalam fenomena terjadinya normalisasi hubungan antara Israel dengan Uni Emirat Arab (UEA). Hubungan antara Israel dengan negara-negara Arab teluk tidak terjalin dengan baik, terlebih bila melihat faktor sejarah yang memperlihatkan adanya rekam jejak konflik antara Israel dengan negara-negara Arab serta ditambah dengan adanya perbedaan identitas. Maka, dalam fenomena ini, UEA bisa disebut sebagai salah satu simbol kekuatan negara-negara Arab terutama di negara-negara teluk, selain Arab Saudi. Hubungan antara Israel dan Uni Emirat Arab sebenarnya sudah mulai terjalin sejak adanya perusahaan energi asal Israel yang berdiri di UEA. Namun kedua negara akhirnya mendeklarasikan adanya hubungan diplomatik, melalui mediasi AS. Secara umum, normalisasi hubungan antara Israel dan UEA lebih kepada kerjasama yang menyasar ke beberapa sektor mulai dari ekonomi hingga transfer teknologi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nNormalisasi hubungan antara Israel dan UEA, tidak lepas dari peran Amerika Serikat. Presiden AS, Donald Trump merupakan mediator antara Perdana Menteri Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu dan Pimpinan UEA Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan sehingga keputusan untuk melakukan normalisasi penuh antara Israel dan UEA, bisa terealisasi. Momentum normalisasi dengan Israel, ternyata juga terlebih dahulu didukung oleh negara-negara Arab lainnya seperti Bahrain, Oman dan Mesir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nNamun, perjanjian yang dimediasi oleh Amerika Serikat melalui Presiden Donald Trump memicu berbagai reaksi dari beberapa negara Arab lain, khususnya Palestina. Palestina menjadi salah satu negara yang menentang adanya normalisasi antara Israel dan UEA. Keputusan ini dianggap akan semakin menekan Palestina, terutama perihal isu sengketa wilayah Tepi Barat. Meskipun normalisasi antara Israel dan UEA berdampak pada ditundanya aneksasi Israel terhadap wilayah Tepi Barat, namun rencana tersebut masih akan direalisasikan dalam waktu yang belum dapat dipastikan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSelain Palestina, negara lain yang lantang menentang normalisasi Israel-UEA adalah Iran. Iran secara tegas tidak mendukung upaya normalisasi kedua negara tersebut. Presiden Iran, Hassan Rouhani, bahkan menyatakan bahwa kesepakatan tersebut telah melukai rakyat Palestina. Pro dan kontra terlihat dari berbagai reaksi atas normalisasi yang terjadi. Meski demikian, kesepakatan normalisasi antara Israel dan UEA tetap berjalan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nIran menjadi salah satu negara yang cukup khawatir dengan terealisasinya hubungan normalisasi ini karena melihat posisi Israel dan UEA yang notabene merupakan&nbsp; negara yang aktif memasok persenjataan dari AS. Kondisi ini tentu membuat Iran lebih waspada, meskipun UEA telah menyatakan bahwa normalisasi ini bukan untuk menekan Iran melainkan sebatas untuk kepentingan melindungi perbatasan. Kekhawatiran Iran terhadap kesepakatan ini terlebih karena alasan keamanan, bisa dipahami bila melihat data dari <em>Stockholm Peace Research and Institute</em> (SIPRI) 2013 -2017,&nbsp; posisi UEA yang merupakan negara&nbsp; Arab teluk yang menempati posisi ke-2 setelah Arab Saudi, sebagai negara importir persenjataan dalam jumlah besar dari AS. Sementara Israel, masih menjadi salah satu negara yang mengimpor persenjataan dalam jumlah besar dari AS .</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nKondisi ini semakin menguatkan dugaan bahwa adanya upaya AS untuk membendung Iran terutama dalam hal persenjataan. Terlebih baru-baru ini, upaya AS di DK-PBB masih stagnan&nbsp; karena pemberian sanksi terhadap Iran terkait pengayaan nuklir ditolak oleh mayoritas anggota DK-PBB, karena AS dinilai sudah meninggalkan kesepakatan nuklir Iran. Tentunya, hal ini membuat AS harus menemukan cara lain agar tujuannya bisa terealisasi, dan salah satunya bisa melalui kesepakatan normalisasi hubungan antara Israel-UEA. Cara yang digunakan AS untuk menekan Iran, cukup identik dengan cara yang dipergunakan oleh Henry Kissinger untuk membendung Uni Soviet yaitu konsep <em>Realpolitik</em>. Pendekatan Kissinger ke RRT pada pemerintahan Mao Ze Dong, bisa tergambarkan melalui kesepakatan Israel-UEA. Dalam hal ini, posisi UEA dapat disejajarkan dengan RRT pada saat itu. Namun, dalam fenomena ini, AS menggunakan Israel untuk melakukan negosiasi dengan UEA. Langkah ini disinyalir menjadi pijakan awal bagi AS untuk mengontrol Iran mengingat AS tidak mampu mengontrol gerak-gerik Iran melalui PBB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nKondisi ini seolah menggambarkan adanya upaya menciptakan <em>Balance of Power </em>oleh AS, melalui Israel di kawasan Timur Tengah. Seperti yang dikemukakan oleh John Mersheimer bahwa keamanan dapat dicapai apabila terjadi keseimbangan dalam hal kekuatan militer.&nbsp; Joseph Grieco juga menegaskan hal serupa, bahwa keamanan bisa dicapai dengan adanya suatu jaminan akan kekuatan militer yang seimbang.&nbsp; Kondisi inilah yang berusaha diciptakan oleh AS melalui normalisasi Israel-UEA, dengan tujuan, secara tidak langsung mengontrol perkembangan persenjataan Iran di kawasan Timur Tengah. Meski normalisasi tersebut membuat Iran sedikit bereaksi, namun belum ada upaya keras dari Iran terhadap UEA, mengingat UEA merupakan salah satu mitra dagang terbesar bagi Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nMelihat situasi ini, eskalasi konflik di kawasan Timur Tengah bisa terus meningkat, karena negara-negara selain Iran, mulai memberikan reaksi cukup keras. Seperti halnya Palestina yang menarik Duta Besarnya dari UEA serta Turki yang mulai mempertimbangkan untuk menangguhkan hubungan diplomatik dengan UEA.&nbsp; Namun, UEA sendiri menyatakan tidak memiliki niat untuk menekan Iran melalui kesepakatan&nbsp; normalisasi dengan Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/Rm5FyRjtXAeU-3EP.jpg\" style=\"height:434px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Image: <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/indefensible-kissinger-102123\">Source</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Aroma <em>Realpolitik</em> gaya Henry Kissinger, cukup terasa di dalam upaya normalisasi Israel-UEA yang dimediasi oleh AS. Apabila pada masa Perang Dingin, AS berhasil membendung pengaruh Uni Soviet sehingga Uni Soviet melalui Presiden Leonid Brezhnev bersedia mengadakan kesepakatan SALT I bersama dengan AS. Sementara,&nbsp; dalam fenomena normalisasi Israel-UEA, AS bisa saja berpotensi mengontrol ekonomi serta persenjataan Iran sekaligus Israel yang mampu meraup dukungan dari negara-negara Arab teluk untuk memuluskan kepentingannya terhadap Palestina. Namun sepertinya hal tersebut belum tentu membuat Iran mudah untuk melunak dan melakukan negosiasi dengan AS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSementara itu, isu sengketa wilayah antara Israel dan Palestina menjadi penghalang bagi keinginan AS dan Israel untuk menjalin hubungan diplomatik dengan beberapa negara Arab teluk lainnya. Normalisasi antara Israel-UEA, bahkan bisa menuju ke arah konflik khususnya bagi negara-negara Arab teluk karena bertentangan dengan kesepakatan <em>Arab Peace Initiative</em>. Kesepakatan tersebut secara tegas menekankan bahwa perdamaian antara negara-negara Arab dan Israel hanya bisa tercapai bila Israel menyerahkan wilayah yang dicaplok dari Palestina sejak tahun 1967. Negara Arab teluk seperti Arab Saudi masih menjadikan kesepakatan <em>Arab Peace Initiative</em> sebagai acuan untuk menormalisasi hubungan dengan Israel. Hal ini memperlihatkan bahwa negara-negara Arab teluk belum satu suara terkait kesepakatan normalisasi Israel-UEA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nKonsep <em>Realpolitik</em> Kissinger yang coba diinisiasi oleh AS di kawasan Timur Tengah, belum menjamin terciptanya suatu keberhasilan untuk mencapai kepentingan AS maupun Israel. Upaya penetrasi Israel ke negara-negara Arab justru berpotensi memicu terjadinya gesekan di antara negara-negara Arab teluk serta mengancam stabilitas keamanan di kawasan Timur Tengah. Terlebih, Arab Saudi yang merupakan kekuatan paling besar di lingkaran negara-negara Arab teluk, masih belum memutuskan untuk menormalisasi hubungan dengan Israel. Demikian halnya,bila tujuan AS yaitu untuk menekan Iran maka upaya <em>Realpolitik</em> Kissinger yang coba diinisiasi oleh AS melalui normalisasi Israel-UEA, sulit terealisasi. Iran yang sejauh ini konsisten menolak segala bentuk tekanan dari AS, justru semakin membuat tensi kedua negara semakin memanas. Hal ini, bahkan berpotensi menciptakan ketidakseimbangan di kawasan Timur Tengah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nPada intinya, di tengah situasi tatanan global yang <em>multipolar</em> seperti sekarang ini, memiliki kondisi yang berbeda dengan era Perang Dingin yang cenderung <em>bipolar</em>. Dunia tidak lagi hanya memiliki dua poros kekuatan, melainkan banyak kekuatan baru yang bermunculan, mulai dari aktor negara maupun non-negara. Kekuatan lain berbentuk aktor non-negara seperti DK-PBB yang memiliki kekuatan untuk menolak keinginan AS yaitu memulihkan sanksi embargo senjata&nbsp; terhadap Iran. Di kawasan Timur Tengah, kekuatan baru lainnya yaitu negara-negara Arab teluk yang membentuk aliansi dalam bidang ekonomi, politik dan sosial bernama GCC (<em>Gulf Cooperation Council</em>) untuk memperkuat stabilitas kawasan Timur Tengah.

Achmad Djatmiko, MA (A.D):&nbsp; Secara pribadi, saya ingin memberikan kontribusi terhadap khasanah kajian hubungan internasional (HI). Saya merasa bahwa berbagai literatur dan pendekatan dalam kajian HI yang selama ini berlaku dan dipejajari dunia akademik maupun khalayak terkesan tidak membumi, melayang-layang di awan. Fenomena, sejarah dan teori yang barlatar belakang dunia Timur (Asia), termasuk agama (religi)&nbsp; sangat jarang diungkap, apalagi dijadikan rujukan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sejak kelahiran HI sebagai disiplin ilmu tersendiri di Barat, agama tidak pernah dipertimbangan sebagai objek kajian. Agama dikucilkan, dipinggirkan, bahkan diasingkan dalam teori HI Barat. Pengasingan agama ini dapat dirunut pada sejarah lahirnya teori HI itu sendiri. Dalam sistem Westphalia, kajian HI dikembangkan pada akhir perang Eropa, yang kemudian melahirkan konsep negara-bangsa (<em>nationstate</em>), mengagungkan kedaulatan nasional sehingga agama tidak lagi diberi tempat semestinya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Dalam teori HI yang fokus kajiannya pada negara (<em>state-centered</em>) dalam bingkai suatu sistem internasional, maka sangat wajar jika agama dianggap tidak memiliki andil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Hi.id: Apa urgensi memasukkan agama dalam kajian Hubungan Internasional?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nA.D: Dalam tradisi kajian HI, dan juga ilmu sosial pada umumnya, agama memang tidak pernah mendapatkan perhatian sebagai faktor penting ataupun variabel analisis karena dianggap tidak memiliki peran dan dampak terhadap kehidupan masyarakat, apalagi hubungan antar negara. Ini dapat difahami karena para pakar ilmu sosial dan filsuf terkemuka dunia Barat di Abad ke-18 hingga awal Abad ke-20 seperti Comte, Durkheim, Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, Voltaire dan Weber, telah memberikan pengaruh besar terhadap perkembangan ilmu sosial, dengan kesamaan pandangan bahwa hadirnya masa Pencerahan (<em>enlightenment</em>) akan memusnahkan agama sebagai landasan pemikiran dan pengaturan dunia. Dalam teori HI yang fokus kajiannya pada negara (<em>state-centered</em>) dalam bingkai suatu sistem internasional, agama dianggap tidak memiliki andil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSelama lebih dari dua dasawarsa terakhir ini kajian HI dihadapkan pada sebuah fenomena global yaitu kebangkitan kembali agama (<em>global resurgence</em>). Fenomena ini menjadi tantangan tersendiri bagi logika sekularisme yang telah mendominasi kajian HI. Fenomena ini dapat menjadi momentum bagi para pengamat dan pecinta HI untuk berkontribusi mengenai arti pentingnya agama sebagai bahan variable HI. Kebangkitan global agama ini membawa serta kecenderungan desekularisasi dunia. Tragedi serangan 11 September 2001, misalnya, telah merubah cara pandang masyarakat terhadap agama dan isu-isu internasional. Atas dasar inilah agama diibaratkan telah kembali dari &ldquo;pengasingan Westphalia&rdquo; ke panggung utama dunia. Agama tidak lagi hanya dipandang sebagai &ldquo;kelanjutan politik dengan cara yang lain (<em>a continuation of politics by other means</em>), tetapi juga telah menjadi sumber konflik para pemain di panggung internasional. Tantangan teoritis dari kebangkitan global agama ini bagi kajian HI sangat urgen untuk dijawab,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Hi.id: Bagaimana dampak yang ditimbulkan dari kebangkitan kembali Agama secara global?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nA.D: Terlihat jelas bahwa kebangkitan agama telah menyadarkan para pemerhati hubungan internasional bahwa selama ini agama telah dimarginalkan dalam kajian HI dan politik khususnya serta ilmu sosial pada umumnya. Bahwa dalam perkembangannya keberadaan agama tidak mungkin lagi dikesampingkan sebagaimana yang telah terjadi selama ini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDari beberapa literatur mengenai agama dan politik global, belum didapatkan kesepakatan ataupun strategi teoritis yang mapan untuk memahami keberadaan agama. Teori HI memberikan informasi yang sangat sedikit kepada siapa yang ingin memahami interaksi agama dan politik di panggung global. Sangat disayangkan bahwa perkembangan konseptual dan teoritis saat ini pun tetap masih berada pada tataran yang sama, agama diposisikan terkucil dalam kajian HI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nDemikian pula, sejalan dampak kebangkitan agama, kini telah muncul beragam pandangan mengenai teori agama, budaya dan sekularisasi. Pertanyaan mengenai kaitan faktor agama dengan Peristiwa 9/11 pun akhirnya&nbsp; menjadi topik pemicu yang kemudian semakin menarik untuk terus diperbincangkan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/oLUu8240eRyi6fou.jpeg\" style=\"height:286px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: Achmad Djatmiko</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong>Hi.id: Di buku ini anda menyinggung tentang westphalian presumption. Bagaimana tanggapan anda tentang Westphalian Presumption dan relevansinya dalam Hubungan Internasional kontemporer?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nA.D: Dalam kajian HI diyakini bahwa sekularisasi (privatisasi dan marginalisasi kepercayaan agama) adalah senjata utama untuk merealisasikan lahirnya politik internasional modern, yang oleh Scott diistilahkan sebagai &ldquo;<em>Westphalian presumption</em>&rdquo; atau &ldquo;Anggapan Westphalia&rdquo;,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<em>Westphalian presumption</em> yaitu suatu gagasan bahwa budaya dan pluralisme agama tidak boleh berada di ranah publik karena akan menimbulkan konflik dengan tatanan international. Agama perlu diprivatisasi dengan cara dilembagakan, yang oleh Charles Taylor disebut sebagai etika bebas sekuler (<em>secular independent ethics</em>). Sistem Westphalia telah menetapkan sekularisme sebagai kode genetik dalam disiplin HI. Tujuannya untuk mengalihkan sekularisme kedalam suatu kondisi yang memungkinkan HI berkembang, daripada menjadi sebuah obyek dari penelitian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong>HI.id: Apa hal yang ingin anda sampaikan pada masyarakat melalui karya anda ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nA.D: Beragam bahasan mengenai kebangkitan global agama dan sejauhmana dampaknya terhadap kajian poltik dan HI dapat menyadarkan kita bahwa agama sebagai suatu yang melekat dengan diri kita, pasti ada dan dimiliki dalam kehidupan individu setiap hari, keberadaannya, secara ilmiah, justeru dipertanyakan. Ternyata, kita tidak bisa mengatakana bahwa agama dianggap sebagai pasti ada dan berperan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Seperti apakah bentuknya, dan bagaimana peran yang dimainkan agama dalam politik dan hubungan internasional sesungguhnya belum dapat diformulasikan dengan jelas karema belum dirumuskan dan disepakati secara ilmiah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id: Apakah anda berkenan untuk dihubungi berkaitan dengan buku ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.D: Ya.

Saya sempat bercita-cita menjadi seorang pilot komersil, namun ada jalan hidup menuntun saya ke arah lain yang harus saya lalui. <em>Concern</em> awal saya dalam melihat korelasi antara aviasi dengan Hubungan Internasional sebenarnya secara tidak disengaja.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pada waktu saya sudah memasuki semester untuk menyusun skripsi S1, pada saat itu sudah ada beberapa <em>draft </em>topik penelitian lainnya seperti ekonomi-politik, <em>development</em>, sampai diplomasi budaya. Namun, karena kurangnya atensi dan belum terbukannya cakrawala saya mengenai apa itu skripsi, menjadikan topik-topik tersebut tidak berlanjut sampai selesai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pada suatu waktu, saya bertemu dengan teman lama yang menjadi pilot komersil nasional di bandar udara Changi, Singapura. Pertemuan tersebut tidak berlangsung lama, karena saya baru datang untuk urus keluarga dan teman saya akan pulang ke Jakara selepas <em>day off</em>. Ada satu percakapan yang menarik bagi saya waktu itu, yakni mengenai keberadaan ruang udara Indonesia yang diatur oleh otoritas Singapura.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Singakat cerita, pada saat teman saya berada di ruang udara di atas Kepulauan Riau, harus melapor kepada otoritas Singapura dan bukan kepada pihak Indonesia. Selepas saya kembali ke Jakarta, saya mencari-cari informasi kebenaran tersebut, dan dari apa yang saya temukan bahwa permasalahan ruang udara tersebut merupakan suatu kajian dalang lingkup Hubungan Internasional. Cerita selanjutnya merupakan sejarah tersendiri disamping topik aviasi internasional merupakan tema dari Tesis serta yang saya tuangkan kedalam buku &ldquo;Politik Aviasi dan Tantangan Negara Kepulauan&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<em><strong>HI.id: Tolong jelaskan bagaimana melihat aviasi dari kaca mata Politik Internasional?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">S.I: Politik internasional merupakan interaksi antar beberapa aktor yang berpartisipasi di dalamnya, seperti negara-negara, organisasi interansional, organisasi non-pemeritah, serta individu-individu. Jika merujuk kepada tujuan dasar dari Hubungan Internasional adalah untuk mempelajari perilaku-perilaku para aktor-aktor yang berinteraksi di dalamnya melalui wujud kerjasama, pembentukan aliansi, serta interaksi dalam organisasi internasional, maka dunia aviasi global baik secara perilaku maupun struktur dapat dikategorikan termasuk dalam kriteria tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Isu-isu yag berkaitan secara langsung maupun tidak langsung dengan aviasi internasional dapat mempengaruhi pola interaksi bagi politik internasional. Isu-isu tersebut dapat mempengaruhi cara pandang suatu pemerintahan dengan pemerintahan lainnya, atau bagaimana individu melihat keberadaan negaranya dan negara lainnya. Perkembangan pesat dalam dunia aviasi internasional melibatkan kepentingan serta kemanan nasional, kedaulatan, serta martabat hamper di semua negara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Seperti contoh maskapai EL AL yang di tumpangi oleh Perdana menteri Israel diharuskan untuk menghindari dan memutar wilayah kedaulatan ruang udara Indonesia ketika menuju Australia, karena Israel tidak memiliki hubungan diplomatik dengan Indonesia. Atau jika kita cermati konflik bersenjata dalam kurun waktu 10 tahun terakhir, terdapat pola yang sama bagaimana suatu negara untuk melakukan serangan pendahuluan (<em>preemptive strike</em>) dengan memanfaatkan ruang udara sebagai kunci kemenangan konflik tersebut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id: Di dalam buku ini, anda menyinggung tentang rezim aviasi internasional. Tolong jelaskan sedikit yang dimaksud dengan rezim aviasi internasional?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">S.I: Jika melihat perilaku serta struktur yang membentuk aviasi global, hal tersebut dapat disejajarkan dengan keberadaan suatu rezim atau sistem interansional dengan segala predikat yang melekat di dalamnya. Penteorisasian terhadap aviasi internasional sendiri terjadi beriiringan dengan perkembangan dalam kajian Hubungan Internaisonal khususnya pada kurun waktu 1970-80an, pada saat konsep rezim mulai dikenal dan di pelajari.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Menurut Martin Litz dan Volker Rittberger, keberadaan suatu rezim tersebut dibentuk oleh adanya suatu bidang permasalahan yang secara khusus menjadi bagian dari ruang kebijakan lebih luas. Isu-isu penting dalam aviasi internasional yang berkaitan degan keberadaan suatu rezim, pada dasarnya menjadi subjek perdebatan antara Realisme dengan Liberalisme yang merupakan pusat fondasi paradigma historis dalam kajian Hubungan Interansional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSebagai organisasi interansional yang memiliki fokus pada isu-isu berkaitan dengan aviasi tingkat global, ICAO (<em>International Civil Aviation Organization</em>) memiliki peraturan-peraturan berupa produk hukum yang merupakan salah satu ciri khas dari keberadaan rezim internasional. Meskipun antara rezim interansional dan organisai interansional tidak memiliki kesamaan, namun menurut Stephen D. Krasner, berpendapat bahwa antara organisasi interansional dengan rezim internaisonal saling bersilangan yang dapat menyediakan prosedur pelaksaan bagi suatu rezim internasional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id: Apa dampak rezim aviasi internasional terhadap Indonesia? Bagaimana Politik Luar Negeri Indonesia terkait rezim aviasi intenrasional ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">S.I: Keanggotaan ICAO mengikuti keanggotaan PBB seperti yang tertuang pada konstitusi organisasi. Sebagai negara anggota ICAO, menjadikan Indonesia wajib untuk menerapkan segala peraturan-peratuan hukum maupun teknis ICAO yang termuat dalam 19 Annexes, yang berlaku dan diterapkan oleh seluruh anggota organisasi. Salah satu isu contoh penerapan peraturan-peraturan oleh ICAO yang berdampak merugikan bagi Indonesia adalah keberadaan ruang udara di atas Kepulauan Riau yang saat ini masih dikontrol oleh otoritas Singapura.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Secara historis dikontrolnya ruang udara tersebut oleh Singapura dimulai sejak tahun 1946. Keputusan ICAO dengan menunjuk Singapura dalam mengontrol ruang udara karena keadaan Indonesia pada saat itu masih berfokus dalam upaya untuk mempertahankan kemerdekaan. Keadaan wilayah ruang udara kedaulatan Indonesia yang dikontrol oleh otoritas Singpaura, dalam pelaksanaannya menimbulkan kendala operasional baik yang dirasakan oleh penerbangan sipil Indonesia maupun pelaksanaan operasi penegakan hukum yang dilakukan oleh otoritas Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pemerintah Indonesia berusaha kembali untuk mendapatkan ruang udara tersebut dalam upaya peningkatan teknis ataupun regulasi-regulasi dalam rangka memenuhi standar penilaian yang dikeluarkan oleh ICAO. Terlebih pada konstitusi ICAO terdapat status atau kedudukan dari negara-negara anggota. Keanggotaan tersebut berupa negara dengan keanggotaan biasa ataupun negara denga keanggotaan Dewan (<em>Council</em>), dengan serangkaian hak serta kewajiban sesuai dengan kedudukan negara tersebut. Hal ini tentu menjadi tantangan tersendiri bagi Indonesia, menggingat Singapura merupakan salah satu anggota Dewan ICAO sedangkan posisi Indonesia saat ini hanya menjadi anggota biasa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Selain utamanya sebagai<em> safety</em> yang menjadi tuntutan dalam dunia aviasi internasional, peningkatan kemampuan dan kapabilitas pada sektor ini dapat digunakan sebagai daya tawar (bargaining position) bagi Indonesia dalam kancah politik luar negeri yang dilakukan. Hal ini diperlukan oleh Indonesia mengingat capaian hasil dari dalam negeri dengan segala upaya peningkatan yang dibutuhkan untuk mencapai standard ICAO, dilihat sebagai pembuktian kesiapan bagi Indonesia untuk mengabil alih kembali ruang udara di atas Kepulauan Riau dan sebagai bagian dari kepentingan nasional Indonesia di ruang udara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong>HI.id: Apa tantangan bagi aviasi Indonesia khususnya sebagai negara kepulauan?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">S.I: Pertanyaan sangat baik sekali! Melalui buku ini dan dalam beberapa kesempatan saya untuk menulis artikel, kuliah umum, maupun melalui media sosial lainnya, saya memiliki mimpi untuk menjadikan Indonesia berdaulat di ruang udara dalam hal ini marwah bangsa termasuk di dalamnya penguasaan teknologi kedirgantaraaan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Setiap negara bangsa di dunia ini memiliki ciri khas wawasan nasionalnya tersendiri. Dimana dalam peran fungsinya merupakan suatu representasi atau cara pandang dari suatu bangsa dalam menempakan diri terhdap lingkungan di sekitarnya. Pada masa kejayaan Kerajaan Majapahit, mengisahkan upaya Mahapatih Gadjah Mada dalam mempersatukan daerah di luar wilayah Majapahit yang terdiri dari Hasta Dwipa (delapan kepulauan/kawasan) sebagai identitas teritori nasional. Dimana pada generasi berikutnya memaknai pesan sejarah tersebut sebagai dasar pemahaman dari Wawasan Nusantara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid img-responsive\" src=\"/main/admin/uploads/blog/3UT-JpHd_hZyi3OI.jpg\" style=\"height:197px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Foto: Syarif Iqbal</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pengeretian Wawasan Nusantara berarti melihat atau memandang &lsquo;wawas&rdquo; dengan nusantara saat ini dimaknai sebagai satu kesatuan wilayah perairan (archipelagic state) dan gugusan pulau-pulau yang terletak diantara dua samudra (Hindia dan Pasifik) serta dua benua (Australia dan Asia). Wawasan Nusantara, yang secara konseptual merupakan pengembangan kehidupan berbangsa sebagai satu kesatuan wilayah yang terdiri dari darat, laur serta ruang udara di atasnya. Melalui Wawasan Nusantara, keterkaitannya dengan ruang udara merupakan anugerah dari Tuhan yang tidak ternilai utamanya bagi bangsa Indonesia. Di dalamnya terkandung potensi dengan berbagai pendayagunaan untuk kepentingan masyarakat, negara dan bangsa Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id: Apa pesan yang ingin anda sampaikan melalui karya anda ini kepada masyarakat maupun penstudi HI lainnya?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">S.I: Pesan dari saya, menekankan kembali bahwa Wawasan Nusantara meihat keadaan fisik Indonesia berupa 1/3 daratan, 2/3 perairan, dan 3/3 merupakan ruang duara merupakan rahamat Tuhan bagi bangsa ini. Dunia aviasi seperti menjadi &ldquo;anak tiri&rdquo; sebagai suatu kajian untuk dipelajari dari sudut keilmuan Hubungan internasional. Dapat disadari bahhwa keberadaan literatur maupun kajian-kajian ilmiah Hubungan Internasional yang memfokuskan pada aviasi tidak sebangau jika kita melihat pada disiplin Ilmu Hukum, Utamanya Hukum Interanansional maupun Hukum Udara dan Angkasa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Menyadari hal tersebut, di dalam buku ini saya menoba membumikan, menguraikan, menjelaskan, dan meganalisa hubungan timbal balik antara aviasi global dengan politik interasional dan khususnya bagi Indonesia. Setidaknya terdapat dua alasan mengapa aviasi layak untuk dijadikan bahan kajian Hubungan Internasional melaui buku ini. <em>Pertama</em>, perkembangan dunia aviasi secara global efektif memiliki kontribusi dalam perubahan pola sistem internasional <em>bipolar</em> menjadi <em>multipolar</em>. <em>Kedua</em>, cakupan isu-isu dalam aviasi internasional berkaitan erat dengan aspek keamanan-pertahanan yang merupakan sifat dasar paradigma Realisme, dengan <em>interdependence</em> dalam model ruang lingkup ekonomi sebagai aspek yang selalu dikaitkan dengan paradigma Liberalisme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Diharapkan dengan keberadaan buku ini dapat mengisi kekosongan bagi para mahsiswa, pemerhati, pratiksi, dan masyarakat pada umumnya yang memiliki ketertarikan dengan dunia aviasi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HI.id: Apakah anda berkenan jika dihubungi terkait karya anda ini?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S.I: Ya.
